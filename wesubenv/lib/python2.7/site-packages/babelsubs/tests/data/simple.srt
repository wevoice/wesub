00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:02,093
We started <b>Universal Subtitles</b> because we believe

2
00:00:02,093 --> 00:00:06,063
every video on the web should be subtitle-able.

3
00:00:06,063 --> 00:00:11,050
Millions of Deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers require subtitles to access video.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,025
Videomakers and websites should <i>really</i> care about this stuff too.

5
00:00:15,025 --> 00:00:20,076
Subtitles give them access to a <u>wider audience</u> and they also get better search rankings.

6
00:00:20,076 --> 00:00:27,026
Universal Subtitles makes it incredibly easy to add subtitles to almost any video.

7
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:32,033
Take an existing video on the web, submit the <b>URL<br/></b> to our website

8
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:39,003
and then type along with the dialog
to create the subtitles

9
00:00:39,003 --> 00:00:44,049
After that, tap on your keyboard to sync them with the video.

10
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:47,041
Then you're doneâ€” we give you an embed code for the video

11
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,076
that you can put on any website

12
00:00:49,076 --> 00:00:53,045
at that point, viewers are able to use the subtitles and can also

13
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:55,083
contribute to translations.

14
00:00:55,083 --> 00:01:01,041
We support videos on YouTube, Blip.TV, Ustream, and many more.

15
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:05,023
Plus we're adding more services all the time

16
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:08,068
Universal Subtitles works with many popular video formats,

17
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:13,079
such as MP4, theora, webM and <i>&</i> HTML 5.

18
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:19,041
Our goal is for every video on the web to be subtitle-able so that anyone who cares about \<script\>alert\<script\>

19
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:22,066
the video can help make it more accessible.<script>alert</script>
