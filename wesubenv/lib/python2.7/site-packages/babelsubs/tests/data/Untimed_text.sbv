9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
Comfortably get back into the rhythm again, 
heart rate was peaking up at 170.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
I'm gutted. 
Absolutely gutted.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
Got it back in my legs to get 
to the top but, snow's in the way.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
Just want to go and have a look. 
Just round that corner and if there's tarmac...

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
This is nuts! Just that corner there, 
I carry the bike through to there and I'm off.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
What?
No, I need to get up round here. Anyone?

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
12 metres high mate, 
we've gotta go back.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
What the snow?
Yeah. We cant go on.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
He's saying you could die mate, 
we've gotta go.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
Thank you.
Thank you.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
Yesterday, after we got snowed out 
of Madeleine, ah, I was absolutely gutted.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
My legs would've got me up there, 
but Madeleine said no.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
I had a bit of a brief this morning, 
as to what's to come...

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
So today we've got another legendary 
Tour de France climb for you to take on,

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
the Col de la Croix de Fer 
which is the "Call of the Iron Cross".

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
It was first used in the tour in 1947.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
So they've been coming up 
here for over 50 years.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
The last 5 or 6k's from what I hear 
is gonna smash my legs to pieces.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
I'm gunning for this one. 
I need this one in the bag.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
[Music]

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
There you go buddy.  
Thank you.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
[Music plays again]

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
Just find a good rhythm.
Yeah.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
Find a good rhythm, tap it out.
Feel the rhythm! Feel the rhythm!

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
[laughs]

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
Ahh, I've got no pacing left.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
You can do it. 
Dig, dig, dig, dig!

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
Oh (breathes heavily).

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
This is not your lungs, 
it's your legs just exploding.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
We're coming into cloud land now. 
[Puffing] Oh! My ears popped. Jeez.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
You get the impression 
they do not want you at the top.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
[radio static]
...you're about 100 metres away.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
Oh, hands are like ice blocks! 
Feet, can't even feel my toes. Oh.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
Oh my legs! 
Can't even hold a straight line.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
It's such a long day out, 
but, this, don't even know now,

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
how much further you've got to go 
'cos you can't see in front of you.

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
[Applause and cheering]

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
We're getting there are we there? 
Are we there?

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
[Car beeps horn]

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
Yes!

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
[Cheering continues]

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
Yeah! How's that!

9:59:59.000,9:59:59.000
Ollie! Ollie! Ollie!
