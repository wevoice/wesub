        see here, and as I said throughout<br/>

        about different molecular structures<br/>

        reactivity. Now, the structures,<br/>
        I've just repeated the last panel

        of the blackboard that I drew last<br/>

        myself to actually draw out all<br/>

        for the most part, this is not<br/>

        you for example, so remember this<br/>

        on the bottom, let me show you<br/>

        a [inaudible] structure. In skeletal<br/>

        are simply filling in the extra<br/>

      <p begin="00:02:00.46" end="00:02:05.93" style="1">
        I mean. If I were in a rush promptly,<br/>

        part of the molecule. For benzene,<br/>
        I would write this structure. Now,

        implicit in this is the same information<br/>

        here. [inaudible]. Whereas, implicit<br/>

        there's a carbon atom. Because<br/>

        the habit of being able to read<br/>

        about them. As we go on to reactivity,<br/>

        simply focus, give more detail<br/>

        something is happening, and less<br/>

      <p begin="00:03:17.31" end="00:03:21.82" style="1">
        a couple of other structures. If<br/>

        this. There was a good question<br/>

      <p begin="00:03:32.49" end="00:03:36.52" style="1">

        them. But generally, it's good<br/>

      <p begin="00:03:54.20" end="00:03:58.64" style="1">
        charges. If I'm interested in some<br/>

        written in lone pairs of electrons.<br/>

      <p begin="00:08:54.97" end="00:08:59.22" style="1">
        a lily structure. I'm going to,<br/>
        in next weeks discussion sections,
      </p>
      <p begin="00:08:59.97" end="00:09:04.97" style="1">
        throw out some problems very similar<br/>
        to that. Maybe I'll even toss methylaizide
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:05.93" end="00:09:10.26" style="1">
        in there to get you practicing<br/>
        and thinking about writing these
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:10.71" end="00:09:15.10" style="1">
        structures. And if even, if you<br/>
        have. I've seen them before. It's
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:15.43" end="00:09:19.63" style="1">
        confusing, that's why we practice.<br/>
        So I will, I will, either, you
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:19.90" end="00:09:23.75" style="1">
        can catch me, or I will put that<br/>

      <p begin="00:09:24.36" end="00:09:28.56" style="1">
        Alright, let's talk a little bit,<br/>
        also, for organic chemist's thinking
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:29.17" end="00:09:33.26" style="1">
        about various forms of [inaudible].<br/>
        And we've already seen the sorts

      <p begin="00:09:33.75" end="00:09:38.72" style="1">
        of double headed arrows that they<br/>

      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:38.89" end="00:09:43.94" style="1">
        structures are resident structures.<br/>
        And I made the point last time.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:44.43" end="00:09:48.67" style="1">
        This means it's not one, it's not<br/>
        the other. It's not oscillating
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:49.65" end="00:09:54.21" style="1">
        between them. It's both at the<br/>
        same time, all the time. There's
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:55.07" end="00:10:01.83" style="1">
        another type of arrow that helps<br/>
        us think, and that's called a curved

      <p begin="00:10:02.58" end="00:10:08.59" style="1">
        arrow. And as I said before, this<br/>
        is central to organic chemist's
      </p>
      <p begin="00:10:09.67" end="00:10:15.04" style="1">
        thinking. Curved arrow are a way<br/>
        that we represent, we think about,
      </p>
      <p begin="00:10:15.63" end="00:10:20.94" style="1">
        we help conceptualize how electrons<br/>

      <p begin="00:10:21.62" end="00:10:26.43" style="1">
        two resident structures, which,<br/>
        as I said, are both at the same
      </p>
      <p begin="00:10:26.85" end="00:10:31.91" style="1">
        time. Or in a chemical reaction,<br/>

      </p>
      <p begin="00:10:32.41" end="00:10:37.56" style="1">
        at one time to one thing at another<br/>
        time. Let me show you what I mean.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:10:38.06" end="00:10:43.04" style="1">
        I'll start with our acetate [inaudible]<br/>
        ion written as a skeletal. So,
      </p>
      <p begin="00:10:43.57" end="00:10:51.46" style="1">
        here is one resident form of the<br/>

      <p begin="00:10:52.13" end="00:11:00.42" style="1">
        to think about how to get to the<br/>

      </p>
      <p begin="00:11:01.09" end="00:11:08.31" style="1">
        imagine one pair of electrons,<br/>

      </p>
      <p begin="00:11:09.12" end="00:11:17.00" style="1">
        flowing. Into the carbon-oxygen<br/>

        a double bond. If you imagine going<br/>

      <p begin="00:11:22.90" end="00:11:27.48" style="1">
        those electrons, we can't stop<br/>
        at that point because now you have
      </p>
      <p begin="00:11:27.85" end="00:11:32.28" style="1">
        two pairs of electrons here between<br/>

      <p begin="00:11:32.88" end="00:11:37.38" style="1">
        two pairs of electrons, here between<br/>

      <p begin="00:11:37.91" end="00:11:42.64" style="1">
        and another pair of electrons in<br/>
        the bond with carbon. Carbon, in
      </p>
      <p begin="00:11:42.86" end="00:11:47.59" style="1">
        other words, we have ten electrons<br/>

      <p begin="00:11:47.81" end="00:11:52.42" style="1">
        that, so, we have to push. Two<br/>

      </p>
      <p begin="00:11:53.06" end="00:11:58.21" style="1">
        and again I use a curved arrow<br/>

      </p>
      <p begin="00:11:59.13" end="00:12:05.36" style="1">
        that process. And when we're done<br/>
        now what this means is we've gone
      </p>
      <p begin="00:12:05.87" end="00:12:11.62" style="1">
        to a structure in which we now<br/>

        oxygen. [sound] eight electrons,<br/>

      <p begin="00:12:18.40" end="00:12:25.44" style="1">
        a bond. We have a negative charge<br/>

        lower oxygen now, we have a double<br/>

      </p>
      <p begin="00:12:33.05" end="00:12:39.44" style="1">
        that oxygen. And of course, these<br/>
        are just the two resident structures,
      </p>
      <p begin="00:12:40.76" end="00:12:47.100" style="1">
        not one, not the other. [inaudible]<br/>
        at the same time. [sound] [cough]

      <p begin="00:12:49.94" end="00:13:02.53" style="1">
        [sound] [sound] Let's try that<br/>
        same thought process to envision
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:03.59" end="00:13:09.72" style="1">
        the interconversion of the two<br/>
        resident structures of benzene.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:10.78" end="00:13:17.71" style="1">
        And again, I'm going to use the<br/>
        skeletal structures. Get us thinking
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:18.60" end="00:13:24.33" style="1">
        like organic chemists. Actually,<br/>
        I'm going to make this a little
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:25.02" end="00:13:31.43" style="1">
        bit bigger, just because, otherwise,<br/>
        my curved narrows are going to

      <p begin="00:13:31.73" end="00:13:38.05" style="1">
        be crunched for those in the back.<br/>
        And here's a big benzene. So if
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:38.34" end="00:13:44.76" style="1">
        we imagine moving this double bond,<br/>
        the pair of electrons making up
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:45.06" end="00:13:50.88" style="1">
        this double bond. Over between<br/>
        the two carbons on the right. We
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:51.09" end="00:13:55.61" style="1">
        can't stop at that point, because,<br/>
        of course, remember, there's a
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:55.75" end="00:13:59.84" style="1">
        hydrogen here. So that would put<br/>
        ten electrons around this carbon,
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:00.41" end="00:14:04.71" style="1">
        and ten elec-, and this one would<br/>
        still be fine. So we get ten electrons
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:05.42" end="00:14:09.56" style="1">
        around this carbon. So we have<br/>
        to push onward here. Push onward
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:10.21" end="00:14:15.65" style="1">
        here, and when all is said and<br/>
        done, we move this pair of electrons,
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:16.68" end="00:14:21.93" style="1">
        making up the double bond here,<br/>

        bond over here and this pair making<br/>

      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:29.14" end="00:14:36.64" style="1">
        takes us to the other resident<br/>

      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:37.10" end="00:14:43.64" style="1">
        once again, it's not one. It's<br/>
        not the other. It's both at the

      <p begin="00:14:44.10" end="00:15:00.18" style="1">
        same time. [sound] ... &gt;&gt; Do the<br/>

      <p begin="00:15:00.18" end="00:15:02.47" style="1">
        &gt;&gt; Great question. Do the arrows<br/>

      <p begin="00:15:02.89" end="00:15:09.15" style="1">
        it is perfecty alright to write<br/>

      <p begin="00:15:09.78" end="00:15:18.29" style="1">
        good questions? Wouldn't it be<br/>

        So, like this. You will see benzine<br/>
