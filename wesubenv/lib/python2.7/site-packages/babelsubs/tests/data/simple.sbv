We started Universal Subtitles because we believe

0:00:02.932,0:00:06.633
every video on the web should be subtitle-able.

0:00:06.633,0:00:11.500
Millions of Deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers require subtitles to access video.

0:00:11.500,0:00:15.256
Videomakers and websites should really care about this stuff too.

Subtitles give them access to a wider audience and they also get better search rankings.
