1
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Comfortably get back into the rhythm again, 
heart rate was peaking up at 170.

2
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I'm gutted. 
Absolutely gutted.

3
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Got it back in my legs to get 
to the top but, snow's in the way.

4
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Just want to go and have a look. 
Just round that corner and if there's tarmac...

5
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
This is nuts! Just that corner there, 
I carry the bike through to there and I'm off.

6
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
What?
No, I need to get up round here. Anyone?

7
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
12 metres high mate, 
we've gotta go back.

8
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
What the snow?  
Yeah. We cant go on.

9
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
He's saying you could die mate, 
we've gotta go.

10
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Thank you.
Thank you.

11
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Yesterday, after we got snowed out 
of Madeleine, ah, I was absolutely gutted.

12
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
My legs would've got me up there, 
but Madeleine said no.

13
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I had a bit of a brief this morning, 
as to what's to come...

14
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So today we've got another legendary 
Tour de France climb for you to take on,

15
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
the Col de la Croix de Fer 
which is the "Call of the Iron Cross".

16
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
It was first used in the tour in 1947.

17
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So they've been coming up 
here for over 50 years.

18
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
The last 5 or 6k's from what I hear 
is gonna smash my legs to pieces.

19
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I'm gunning for this one. 
I need this one in the bag.

20
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
[Music]

21
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
There you go buddy.  
Thank you.

22
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
[Music plays again]

23
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Just find a good rhythm.
Yeah.

24
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Find a good rhythm, tap it out.
Feel the rhythm! Feel the rhythm!

25
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
[laughs]

26
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Ahh, I've got no pacing left.

27
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
You can do it. 
Dig, dig, dig, dig!

28
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Oh (breathes heavily).

29
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
This is not your lungs, 
it's your legs just exploding.

30
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
We're coming into cloud land now. 
[Puffing] Oh! My ears popped. Jeez.

31
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
You get the impression 
they do not want you at the top.

32
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
[radio static]
...you're about 100 metres away.

33
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Oh, hands are like ice blocks! 
Feet, can't even feel my toes. Oh.

34
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Oh my legs! 
Can't even hold a straight line.

35
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
It's such a long day out, 
but, this, don't even know now,

36
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
how much further you've got to go 
'cos you can't see in front of you.

37
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
[Applause and cheering]

38
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
We're getting there are we there? 
Are we there?

39
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
[Car beeps horn]

40
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Yes!

41
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
[Cheering continues]

42
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Yeah! How's that!

43
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Ollie! Ollie! Ollie! Let three line ends here
