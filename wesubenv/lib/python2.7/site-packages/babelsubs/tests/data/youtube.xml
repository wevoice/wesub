    <text start="11.17" dur="2.659">need to perform a continuity test</text>
    <text start="13.829" dur="4.391">a continuity test will determine if a continuous electrical path</text>
    <text start="18.22" dur="2.209">is present in the switch</text>
    <text start="20.429" dur="4.4">if the switch has continuity it should be functioning properly</text>
    <text start="24.829" dur="6.1">no continuity means the electrical path is broken and the switch has failed</text>
    <text start="30.929" dur="2.35">switches come in many shapes and sizes</text>
    <text start="33.279" dur="4.441">but all of them can be tested for continuity in the same way</text>
    <text start="37.72" dur="4.61">you can choose from a variety of multimeters to perform the test</text>
    <text start="42.33" dur="5.57">for this demonstration we will use both analog and digital models</text>
    <text start="47.9" dur="1.989">when using an analog model</text>
    <text start="49.889" dur="4.35">first rotate the range selection dial to the lowest setting for ohms of</text>
    <text start="54.239" dur="1.141">resistance</text>
    <text start="55.38" dur="3.49">then calibrate the meter by pinching the probes together</text>
    <text start="58.87" dur="5.37">while adjusting the needle to read zero</text>
    <text start="64.24" dur="1.899">when using a digital model</text>
    <text start="66.139" dur="4.371">again rotate the dial to the lowest setting for ohms of resistance</text>
    <text start="70.51" dur="4.71">or resistance with tone if your meter has this option</text>
    <text start="75.22" dur="4.59">before you begin make sure the switch your testing has been removed or</text>
    <text start="79.81" dur="2.349">isolated from the appliance</text>
    <text start="82.159" dur="3.421">use a probe to touch one of the switch&amp;#39;s terminals</text>
    <text start="85.58" dur="3.13">and the second probe to touch the other terminal</text>
    <text start="88.71" dur="2.76">now actuate to switch</text>
    <text start="91.47" dur="3.149">if the meter reading shows zero ohms of resistance</text>
    <text start="94.619" dur="4.311">the switch has continuity</text>
    <text start="98.93" dur="2.2">if the needle does not move</text>
    <text start="101.13" dur="3.419">or the digital display does not change significantly</text>
    <text start="104.549" dur="1.841">there is no continuity</text>
    <text start="106.39" dur="2.06">which means the switch has failed</text>
    <text start="108.45" dur="1.15">and will need to be replaced</text>
    <text start="108.45">no duration</text>
