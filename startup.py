"""startup.py -- code that we run at startup

This module handles running code when we start up.  Currently there are a
couple ways of starting up:
    - mangage.py -- shell and dev servers
    - deploy/unisubs.wsgi -- production server

For any of these cases we should call the startup() function early on in the
startup process.  Right after the django settings are set up is a good time.
