    We use NotificationHandlerBase subclasses to send HTTP notifications to

    - Create a NotificationHandlerBase subclass
        - Implement some of the on_* methods
        - Inside the method send an HTTP notification using
          send_notification().
        - Call the register() class method.
    - Create a TeamNotificationSettings instance using the django admin
       - Set the type to the same type passed to register()
       - Set the URL to the url we should post to.
