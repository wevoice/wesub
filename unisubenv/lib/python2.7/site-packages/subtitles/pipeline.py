"""The subtitle creation pipeline.

To understand why this module/idea is necessary you need to understand the pain
that not having it causes.

In the beginning was videos.models.SubtitleVersion.  When you needed to update
some subtitles for a video, you created a new SubtitleVersion and saved it in
the standard Django manner.  This is simple, but things quickly spiraled out of
control.

First, there are a number of special things you may or may not need to do when
adding a new version.  You need to check that the user actually has permission
to add it.  It probably needs to trigger reindexing (if it's public).  It may
need to interact with tasks.  There are many little things like this.

Second, there are a number of places where we need to add versions.  Obviously
the subtitling dialog needs to create them, as do the Review/Approve dialog.  So
does the "rollback" functionality.  The "upload a subtitle file" process create
versions.

If you try to stick with a simple Django model creation for all the places
versions are created, you need to perform all the fiddly little checks in all
those places.  This quickly becomes painful and unmanageable.

And so we come to the subtitle pipeline.  Its purpose is to encapsulate the
process of adding subtitles to keep all the painful complexity in one place.  In
a nutshell:

                                subtitles go in
                                       ||
                         (pipeline handles everything)
                                       ||
                                       \/
                           SubtitleVersion comes out

    If you already have a transaction running you can use unsafe_add_subtitles

    future.

    Subtitles can be given as a SubtitleSet, or a list of

    Title and description should be strings, or can be omitted to set them to
    ''.  If you want them to be set to the same thing as the previous version
    you need to pass it yourself.

    Author can be given as a CustomUser object.  If omitted the author will be
    marked as anonymous.

    Visibility and visibility_override can be given as the strings 'public' or
    'private', or omitted to use the defaults ('public' and '' respectively).

    Parents can be given as an iterable of parent identifiers.  These can be
    SubtitleVersion objects, or integers representing primary keys of
    SubtitleVersions, or tuples of (language_code, version_number).  Note that
    the previous version of the language (if any) will always be marked as
    a parent.

    Committer can be given as a CustomUser object.  This should be the user
    actually performing the action of adding the subtitles.  Permissions and
    such will be checked as if this user is adding them.  If omitted, the
    permission checks will be skipped, as if a "superuser" were adding the
    subtitles.

    Complete is a deprecated param that is needed for the API.  It alters how
    we handle the subtitles_complete attribute on the language.  New code
    should use action instead.

    action can be given as an action string.  If given, we will perform that
    action using the saved version.

    Created should be a datetime that will set the "created" date for the
    resulting version.  If not given it will default to today.
