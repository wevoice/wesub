# Notification-related signals

# There is quite a bit of indirection here, but the goal is to make
# dispatching these events as simple as possible, since it might occur
# in multiple places.
#
# 1) Client codes dispatches a signal listed in this module:
#    ex: signals.api_on_subtitles_edited.send(subtitle_version)
# 2) The signal calls that handler, which chooses the right event name
#    for the signal and calls the matching sub method (for videos, languages, etc)
# 3) The submethod finds all teams that should be notified (since a video)
#    can belong to more than on team). For each team:
# 3a) Puts the right task on queue, if the teams has a TeamNotificationsSettings
# 3b) The taks querys the TeamNotificationSettings models to fire notifications
# 3c) The TNS checks if there is available data (e.g. which url to post to)
# 3d) Instantiates the right notification class (since specific partners must
#     have their notification data massaged to their needs - e.g. changing the video
#     ids to their own, or the api links to their own endpoints)
# 3e) The notification class fires the notification
