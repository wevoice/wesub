    We have tried to tackle the issue of team workflows in several ways.  The
    most infamous has to be the tasks sytem.  This class acts the glue between
    the new workflow components and the old systems.

    The plan is to migrate all our teams from OldTeamWorkflow to newer
    workflow styles.  At that point we can get rid of OldTeamWorkflow and also
    probably a bunch of other things like the tasks code, the Workflow table,
    several Team model fields, etc.
