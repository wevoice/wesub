Team Workflows
==============

Team workflows are ways for teams to get their subtitling work done.  Team
workflows compliment the :doc:`subtitle-workflows` and add team-specific
features.

Team workflows are responsible for:
    - Providing a SubtitleWorkflow for team videos
    - Handling the workflow settings page
    - Handling the dashboard page
    - Creating extra tabs or the teams section
