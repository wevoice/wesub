class ThirdPartyAccount(models.Model):
    """The (abstract) base model for the concept of a third-party account.

    Each of the subclasses of this class represents one external service.

    Each model instance holds all data related to that external service for
    a given user linked to it.

    For example, "Twitter" is a third-party service, and some Amara accounts may
    be "linked" to Twitter accounts by way of the TwitterAccount model.  The
    TwitterAccount model will hold things like the Twitter username, the OAuth
    access token, etc.

    These links are used for (or are planned to be used for) a variety of things
    on the Amara site, including:

    * Filling in User data automatically, such as the avatar and first/last
      name, so the user doesn't have to type it themselves.
    * Authenticating people into Amara Users without a username/password.
    * Performing actions in the external services themselves on the user's
      behalf, like tweeting a link to things.

    When creating new subclasses of ThirdPartyAccount we shouldn't duplicate
    data that is stored elsewhere (e.g. email address and first/last name, which
    are both in our User model).  If we have to for a client-specific reason
    that's fine, but the User model should always be the main source of truth
    for any of its fields for the Amara site.

    In general, the User <-> TPA relationship should be 1:1.  The exception
    would be if we implemented something like "OpenIDAccount" since it's
    possible a user would want to set up more than one OpenID URL linked to
    their account.

    Theoretically there's no reason one User couldn't link multiple external
    (e.g. Twitter) accounts to a single Amara User account. Maybe they want many
    people to share one Amara account but log in through multiple external
    Twitter accounts.  We don't currently let them but it might be something to
    think about in the future.

    When implementing a subclass of this, the 'kind' attribute should just be
    set to a human-readable name for the type of account, like 'Twitter' or
    'Facebook'.  It will be used in the __unicode__ representation and can be
    used to determine what type of object you're looking at in a pinch (instead
    of looking at the class).

    The identifier property should return the unique "identifier" of that
    account for that service.  For example, for Twitter this would be the
    username, but for Facebook it's the UID because not everyone has a vanity
    username.  This will also be used in the __unicode__ representation.
