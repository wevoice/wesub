<i>[narrator] Once upon a time,</i>

<i>in an office building far, far, away,</i>

<i>a seemingly insignificant business meeting was called...</i>

- <i>[Boss]  I'm very glad you 
all have gathered here.</i>

- If I may ask...

why are we here today?

- You shouldn't ask the boss 
questions like that.

You know how she gets.

- Actually that's a good question.

I mean what's the point, really?

Every week we sit around and gaba gaba--

- Hey!

Don't you think you're being 
a little disrespectful?

- Who asked you?

- <i>[Zeus] I asked her.</i>

- <i>[Boss] Ahh, Zeus!</i>

<i>Greek deity of the sky!</i>

<i>I'm glad you could join us.</i>

- Hey Boss...

What's uh, Zeus, doing at this meeting?

- And how do we know that's Zeus talking?

- Yeah, how do we know that's really Zeus?

- How the [bleep] do I know 
that's [bleep] Zeus?

I'll [bleep] tell you how...

ask him to prove it.

- How are you going to get the 
Greek deity of the sky

to prove he's the Greek deity of the sky?

This is the king of Mount 
<i>Olympus</i> speaking to us

from goodness knows where...

You can't go around questioning the 
authenticity of Greek deities!

You know,

they tend to get

really ticked off!

- <i>[Zeus] I know how I can prove it.</i>

<i>I'll tell you what color 
you're thinking of.</i>

<i>Okay, thinking of one?</i>

<i>Okay...</i>

<i>...now...</i>

<i>Tell me what it is!</i>

- Yellow.
- Blue!

- He was asking me!

- I am pretty sure he was asking me!

- <i>[Boss] Can we please get 
back to our meeting?</i>

- Sorry.
- Sorry.

- <i>[Boss] The thing is...</i>

<i>I've been hearing,</i>

<i>you know,</i>

<i>the way that someone 
HEARS about things...</i>

<i>I hear SOME people around here were...</i>

[thunder]

- <i>[Zeus] Oops!</i>

<i>Excuse me!</i>

- Wowie zowie, that stinks!

- I didn't think thunder <i>had</i> a smell.

- [speaking Spanish]

- Dude! I think I might pass out!

- ♪ [mumbling a song] ♪

- [Boss] What was that?

- Oh, it's just a little something I sing
to myself when I don't feel so good.

- Ooh! I love songs!

What is it?

- ♪ [singing a Woody Guthrie song] ♪

- ♪ [singing] ♪

- ♪ [all singing together] ♪

- ♪ <i>[Zeus singing]</i> ♪

- You skipped a line!

- <i>[Zeus] What?</i>

- Nothing.

- How does Zeus know Woody Guthrie?

- [all] Shhh!

- <i>[Boss] Dismissed!</i>

- [all] Yay!
