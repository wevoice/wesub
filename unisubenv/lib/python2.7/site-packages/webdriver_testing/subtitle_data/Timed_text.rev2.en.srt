<i>This is revision 2</i>

2
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:04,099
<i>in an office building far, far, away,</i>

3
00:00:05,054 --> 00:00:09,048
<i>a seemingly insignificant business meeting was called...</i>

4
00:00:10,047 --> 00:00:12,035
- <i>[Boss]  I'm very glad you 
all have gathered here.</i>

5
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:13,015
- If I may ask...

6
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:14,064
why are we here today?

7
00:00:14,074 --> 00:00:16,041
- You shouldn't ask the boss 
questions like that.

8
00:00:16,046 --> 00:00:17,060
You know how she gets.

9
00:00:18,023 --> 00:00:19,046
- Actually that's a good question.

10
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:20,048
I mean what's the point, really?

11
00:00:20,057 --> 00:00:21,073
Every week we sit around and gaba gaba--

12
00:00:21,078 --> 00:00:22,028
- Hey!

13
00:00:22,037 --> 00:00:24,026
Don't you think you're being 
a little disrespectful?

14
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:25,055
- Who asked you? NOBODY - That's right!!! 

15
00:00:25,087 --> 00:00:26,076
- <i>[Zeus] I asked her.</i>

16
00:00:28,023 --> 00:00:29,046
- <i>[Boss] Ahh, Zeus!</i>

17
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:31,030
<i>Greek deity of the sky!</i>

18
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:33,018
<i>I'm glad you could join us.</i>

19
00:00:34,027 --> 00:00:34,095
- Hey Boss...

20
00:00:35,045 --> 00:00:37,067
What's uh, Zeus, doing at this meeting?

21
00:00:38,015 --> 00:00:40,017
- And how do we know that's Zeus talking?

22
00:00:40,029 --> 00:00:42,021
- Yeah, how do we know that's really Zeus?

23
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,046
- How the [bleep] do I know 
that's [bleep] Zeus?

24
00:00:44,082 --> 00:00:45,095
I'll [bleep] tell you how...

25
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,082
ask him to prove it.

26
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,035
- How are you going to get the 
Greek deity of the sky

27
00:00:50,046 --> 00:00:52,035
to prove he's the Greek deity of the sky?

28
00:00:52,056 --> 00:00:55,032
This is the king of Mount 
<i>Olympus</i> speaking to us

29
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,095
from goodness knows where...

30
00:00:57,011 --> 00:01:00,022
You can't go around questioning the 
authenticity of Greek deities!

31
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:00,085
You know,

32
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:01,067
they tend to get

33
00:01:02,002 --> 00:01:03,050
really ticked off!

34
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,009
- <i>[Zeus] I know how I can prove it.</i>

35
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:06,073
<i>I'll tell you what color 
you're thinking of.</i>

36
00:01:07,053 --> 00:01:08,048
<i>Okay, thinking of one?</i>

37
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:10,050
<i>Okay...</i>

38
00:01:10,062 --> 00:01:11,035
<i>...now...</i>

39
00:01:11,048 --> 00:01:12,037
<i>Tell me what it is!</i>

40
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:14,029
- Yellow.
- Blue!

41
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:16,006
- He was asking me!

42
00:01:16,023 --> 00:01:18,026
- I am pretty sure he was asking me!

43
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,076
- <i>[Boss] Can we please get 
back to our meeting?</i>

44
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:22,051
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

45
00:01:24,026 --> 00:01:25,015
- <i>[Boss] The thing is...</i>

46
00:01:25,075 --> 00:01:27,015
<i>I've been hearing,</i>

47
00:01:27,037 --> 00:01:27,087
<i>you know,</i>

48
00:01:27,098 --> 00:01:30,060
<i>the way that someone 
HEARS about things...</i>

49
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:35,020
<i>I hear SOME people around here were...</i>

50
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:38,075
[thunder]

51
00:01:38,082 --> 00:01:39,051
- <i>[Zeus] Oops!</i>

52
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:41,018
<i>Excuse me!</i>

53
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:45,065
- Wowie zowie, that stinks!

54
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,057
- I didn't think thunder <i>had</i> a smell.

55
00:01:47,095 --> 00:01:53,010

56
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,092

57
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,073
- ♪ [mumbling a song] ♪

58
00:01:59,051 --> 00:02:00,051
- [Boss] What was that?

59
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:04,034
- Oh, it's just a little something I sing
to myself when I don't feel so good.

60
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,076
- Ooh! I love songs!

61
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:06,079

62
