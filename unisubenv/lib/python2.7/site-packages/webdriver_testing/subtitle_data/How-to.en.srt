1
00:00:17,015 --> 00:00:20,023
I talk to lots of people who come here

2
00:00:20,023 --> 00:00:22,005
looking for the Silicon Valley experience

3
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:24,041
They arrive with one suit case in hand

4
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:28,002
when they head south on the 101.

5
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:29,023
Hoping to see it this place they've heard about

6
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:34,073
and its freeways, and its office parks

7
00:00:34,073 --> 00:00:37,046
and its strip malls, and

8
00:00:37,046 --> 00:00:39,022
it looks like every place they've ever been

9
00:00:39,023 --> 00:00:41,089
end up wondering where are they come,

10
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:42,049
why did they come here,

11
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:44,053
what was that brought them

12
00:00:46,092 --> 00:00:51,053
Code itself is the underlying thing that makes computers work

13
00:00:51,053 --> 00:00:54,010
Why is it important to the world, it's because

14
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,020
it's the blood of the organism, that's our culture now,

15
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,020
it makes everything go

16
00:01:01,057 --> 00:01:04,068
Technology has become a God of our society now

17
00:01:04,068 --> 00:01:06,068
I mean I think that its--people stand in awe of it

18
00:01:06,068 --> 00:01:09,037
and stand in awe of the people that make it

19
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:22,062
There's a sense that software is a kind of new frontier

20
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:24,068
it's you know it's the old gold rush metaphor

21
00:01:24,068 --> 00:01:26,068
the California gold rush all over again

22
00:01:26,073 --> 00:01:30,003
It's the kind of Hollywood of the Twenties.

23
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:34,067
This very small set of people is really defining

24
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:36,082
how our world's gonna be like

25
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:40,034
I mean you know the computer becoming ubiquitous

26
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:42,048
and the way we interact with the world

27
00:01:42,048 --> 00:01:45,029
more and more mediated through the computer

28
00:01:45,065 --> 00:01:47,098
is this very small group of people

29
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:50,098
defining what that world's gonna be like.

30
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,048
Netscape!

31
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:54,076
everywhere!

32
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:55,073
team!

33
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,054
fight!

34
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,048
Less than three years ago

35
00:01:59,048 --> 00:02:02,043
a small team of engineers at Netscape Communications

36
00:02:02,043 --> 00:02:05,042
created software that made surfing the Internet easy

37
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:08,056
and in the process change the face of computing

38
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:12,099
On this day however, the company is in big trouble

39
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:17,037
driven to the ground by its rival and software colossus Microsoft

40
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:20,040
Only a radical strategy will help save it.

41
00:02:20,084 --> 00:02:22,088
"Let's hear a loud Mozilla!"

42
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:28,008
Mozilla! Mozilla! Mozilla!

43
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:30,078
Netscape is giving away its source code

44
00:02:30,078 --> 00:02:33,009
to programmers outside the company

45
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:37,024
The source code is the secret formula for browsing the web

46
00:02:38,003 --> 00:02:41,024
The code is named Mozilla and if widely adapted

47
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,003
it will make Netscape's code the Internet standard

48
00:02:44,003 --> 00:02:46,033
drawing users to its other products

49
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:49,031
and restoring the company's sagging fortunes.

50
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:52,040
Our story focuses on team of engineers

51
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,040
who will come together in this building

52
00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:56,040
Over the course of the next year

53
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,058
they will turn their lives inside-out to create Mozilla

54
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:02,059
and battle a giant competitor to save their company

55
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:04,069
and shape the future of computing.

56
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:16,000
Right now we have a problem with the work looks like it can't possibly be done

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,024
for the date we announced

58
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:21,012
so were just trying to

59
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,008
drill down on how doomed we are

60
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:30,050
and sometimes the only way to do that is

61
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,083
to get everybody in the room and stare each other in the eyes.

62
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:35,074
We said were giving you Netscape Communicator on 3/31

63
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:38,063
so if were not giving them Netscape Communicator on 3/31

64
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:40,003
we need a way to address that.

65
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:44,088
The goal is to get Mozilla to developpers by March 31th

66
00:03:44,088 --> 00:03:46,088
a few shorts weeks from now

67
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:50,008
it is one of the most ambitious schedules in the company history.

68
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:50,099
- It's a joke

69
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,094
- I think we have been very exclusive

70
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:02,040
Michael Toy one of Netscape's first employees

71
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,044
heads the team that will prepare Mozilla for public release.

72
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,066
We're probably doomed, we're probably gonna fail

73
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:13,005
Microsoft is probably gonna squish us like bug anyway

74
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:15,015
but just cause were doomed doesn't mean

75
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:18,017
you know we cant get up in the morning and do work

76
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,007
All rise

77
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,080
the honorable Michael Toy presiding.

78
00:04:26,063 --> 00:04:29,014
I'm pretty flip with my kids about what I do.

79
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:32,031
What do you do at work dad? Oh I don't know I sit in meetings

80
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:34,073
and feel depressed and I read e-mail.

81
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,048
Oh oh you got me!

82
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:38,095
But they think my office is the greatest place in the world though

83
00:04:38,095 --> 00:04:40,069
It's like "Oh were going to your office?"

84
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:43,033
"Oh yeah yippie I love going to your office!"

85
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:46,032
They play with the guns and there is free soda

86
00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:48,032
and there is the giant balls

87
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:51,055
basically I work at Disneyland as far as they're concerned.

88
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:54,002
I talk about marathon versus sprint.

89
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,020
The hard part is to run with significant intensity the all way

90
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,057
knowing that if you ever start walking

91
00:04:59,057 --> 00:05:02,039
you're not going to make it and just keep the end in sight

92
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,039
and know that there's this urgency.

93
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:07,083
Jim Roskind an expert on software security

94
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:11,042
is brought in to enforce rigorous standards of engineering precision.

95
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:13,025
Imagine if you had a project

96
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:15,020
where you felt doom was imminent

97
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,088
all the different players wondering

98
00:05:16,088 --> 00:05:18,045
are they pushed beyond their level

99
00:05:18,045 --> 00:05:20,045
can they think of way of running faster,

100
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:21,048
can anyone help them?

101
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:23,037
So there's lot of tension

102
00:05:23,037 --> 00:05:26,006
and anxiety over making the schedule.

103
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:29,055
Jamie Zawinski, free source code evangelist

104
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:32,069
will enlist outside developers to Netscape's cause.

105
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:36,018
The free source thing is trying to change the rules, right.

106
00:05:36,056 --> 00:05:39,056
There are people who have the free software religion,

107
00:05:39,056 --> 00:05:41,094
the one thing they have in common is they're all hackers

108
00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:45,037
they all like writing code

109
00:05:45,074 --> 00:05:48,080
so you hoping to tap in to all of those smart people

110
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,068
and get something from them, you know, so that everyone benefits.

111
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:59,001
I'm talking about two millions, two and half millions lines of code

112
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,001
and everyone of them has to be gone over

113
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:03,027
carefully and in some cases twice.

114
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:10,022
With hundreds of engineers converging on Mozilla,

115
00:06:10,022 --> 00:06:12,022
with new code to enable its release,

116
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:13,085
Tara Hernandez makes sure

117
00:06:13,085 --> 00:06:15,094
that their changes do not crash Mozilla

118
00:06:15,095 --> 00:06:17,087
and brings everyones work to a halt.

119
00:06:18,025 --> 00:06:19,025
This is how we keep track

120
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,080
of all the changes that are going in.

121
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,018
Green is good.

122
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,051
Lot of changes going on right here,

123
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,033
and wham, the build all died.

124
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:29,062
Ok, alright, bye.

125
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:35,036
We're doomed.

126
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:38,095
Some of the worst crashes are reserved for Scott Collins

127
00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:40,093
a veteran code writer who stands by

128
00:06:40,093 --> 00:06:42,097
for late night troubleshooting.

129
00:06:46,022 --> 00:06:48,017
I've been here for about

130
00:06:48,017 --> 00:06:50,017
I don't know, 60 hours or so.

131
00:06:50,017 --> 00:06:52,048
Writing software is different from

132
00:06:52,048 --> 00:06:54,048
selling real estate.

133
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:56,060
Selling real estate you sell the people

134
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,000
the people sleep at night.

135
00:06:58,049 --> 00:07:00,081
When they go to sleep you have to stop selling real estate

136
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:02,027
Computers never sleep.

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,017
You can see my cube is decked out a little bit better than

138
00:07:08,017 --> 00:07:10,017
all the people's.

139
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:13,033
I have a nice couch

140
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,060
little mattress under there I can sleep in

141
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,016
artwork from my children

142
00:07:17,016 --> 00:07:18,075
I have control the light switches.

143
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:21,074
This is what I'd like to get if my wife truly love me

144
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,043
she'd let me have one.

145
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:25,063
Life is good.

146
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:31,048
Ok

147
00:07:32,049 --> 00:07:33,043
Bug count.

148
00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:37,000
Alright, there are a ton of bugs on here that

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,012
people just aren't doing anything about.

150
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:40,056
To give away its code

151
00:07:40,056 --> 00:07:43,074
Netscape engineers must make thousands of bug fixes

152
00:07:43,074 --> 00:07:45,098
Often minute changes that will allow the code

153
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:48,030
to be used by outside developpers.

154
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,087
Jeff Weinstein has, one, two,

155
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:52,026
three, four, five, six,

156
00:07:52,026 --> 00:07:53,075
seven, eight, nine, ten,

157
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:55,070
eleven, twelve, thirteen.

158
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,085
One bug hidden in the mass of code

159
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:59,043
can stop everyone else's work

160
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:01,001
and can threaten the ship date.

161
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:03,027
I need someone to page Jeff Weinstein

162
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:05,024
and get him to call 2024.

163
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:08,000
Even a team of twenty people building a car

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,013
it's easy to step back fourty feet and look and go

165
00:08:10,013 --> 00:08:12,013
"Hold it, that guy has not putting on the wheel"

166
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:14,054
You have fourty programmers working

167
00:08:14,054 --> 00:08:17,016
they all come to you with code, a gigantic morass

168
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:19,068
of little details piled up on a disc

169
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:22,002
usually can even see the pieces whether they're doing it correctly

170
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,055
You have to assemble it into a whole

171
00:08:23,055 --> 00:08:25,004
and then see if the whole works

172
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,031
and then you're not even sure of who gave you the bad bits.

173
00:08:31,087 --> 00:08:33,085
That would be bad. Let's go downstairs, come on!

174
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:35,049
You're talking about a recipe.

175
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,001
Who gave you the bad flour.

176
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:38,039
Someone went out to grind flour,

177
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,072
and they had to all be exactly

178
00:08:39,072 --> 00:08:41,065
the right size chunks of flour.

179
00:08:41,065 --> 00:08:42,096
Someone else made chocolate chips,

180
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:44,096
they all had to be exactly the right size chunks.

181
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:46,084
You can't figure it out until you put it all together

182
00:08:46,084 --> 00:08:47,087
you hand it out, and people go.

183
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:49,034
"I don't like the way this tastes"

184
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,039
And now you have to wonder,

185
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:54,015
with all these details coming together

186
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,084
which was the problem

187
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:57,084
who's causing the problem, how can you fix it?

188
00:08:57,084 --> 00:09:00,039
You've got to ship on a certain time.

189
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,039
And now you have all this people,

190
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:04,099
you have the clock ticking and it gets pretty intense.

191
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:06,070
Since Netscape began

192
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,051
the amount of code making up Mozilla

193
00:09:08,051 --> 00:09:10,051
has increased by a factor of 30.

194
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:13,036
The job of programming and debugging it

195
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:16,040
rests upon a precarious balance of science and art.

196
00:09:18,063 --> 00:09:21,078
They talk about what they do as if

197
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:24,088
it was a kind of alchemy, a kind of wizardry.

198
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:27,098
It does remind me of athletics in that way.

199
00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:30,003
You know why is someone a good baseball hitter?

200
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:33,021
Often the hitters themselves can't really explain it.

201
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:36,000
And often the best software people

202
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,060
cannot themselves understand why they're so good at it.

203
00:09:40,048 --> 00:09:44,003
But I think make a great programmer is being raised techie.

204
00:09:44,003 --> 00:09:47,004
My particular team at Netscape, I think we all grew up techie

205
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:51,012
We all grew up with computers around us somewhere,

206
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:54,013
so that we were exposed to them before we became

207
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,071
adults, if any of us are really adults

208
00:09:57,071 --> 00:09:59,071
Jim is the most grownup of us.

209
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,027
A lot of my childhood from roughly age 6 to age 17

210
00:10:05,027 --> 00:10:06,046
was around here.

211
00:10:06,077 --> 00:10:09,071
Life was just a nightmare, this is a very, very scary place

212
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:11,061
the two school wasn't too bad.

213
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:13,087
Ah, but it meant it

214
00:10:13,087 --> 00:10:16,070
you'd get to work on puzzles and problems.

215
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:20,032
All of the puzzling is math,

216
00:10:20,032 --> 00:10:22,087
and that puzzling is the exact same feeling

217
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:24,053
the exact same problem that you go through

218
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:25,063
when you're programming.

219
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,079
When I was young it'd be building with erector sets and Lego

220
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:33,010
now the structures that you build are in software.

221
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,033
My mom is a first class geek too.

222
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,071
And so I have a unique experience of being able to talk

223
00:10:40,011 --> 00:10:42,096
shop with my mom, cuz' she's a director of

224
00:10:42,096 --> 00:10:45,039
really important stuff at Sun.

225
00:10:47,092 --> 00:10:50,087
At Netscape one of the code words for is the average person

226
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:52,011
who is going to be able to use this software is,

227
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:54,011
"Well can my mom use it?"

228
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,050
Yeah, my mom can use it.

229
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,050
My mom can write optimizing compilers.

230
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:04,067
By the time I was 12 years old I was making 50 bucks an hour

231
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:05,095
programming computers.

232
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:10,062
People say what should I be should I grow up to be a...

233
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:12,009
I say computer programmer.

234
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:19,074
The thing about that makes it a youth culture

235
00:11:19,074 --> 00:11:23,023
is one's capacity to throw one's entire life on the line

236
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:24,049
with these firms

237
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,082
Entire life commitment meaning

238
00:11:27,082 --> 00:11:30,086
24-7-365 work commitment.

239
00:11:33,003 --> 00:11:34,067
It's throwing yourself into a thing

240
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:36,084
where you don't know if that job

241
00:11:36,084 --> 00:11:38,012
is going to be around soon.

242
00:11:38,012 --> 00:11:40,000
There's no stability in here.

243
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,045
So the very kind of weird irony

244
00:11:43,045 --> 00:11:45,061
is that very people who are inventing the future

245
00:11:45,061 --> 00:11:46,066
can't see their own future.

246
00:11:47,092 --> 00:11:49,074
This is a monk-life existence

247
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:51,092
there are very few women in these societies.

248
00:11:51,092 --> 00:11:54,005
These are male societies,

249
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,075
they are secret societies,

250
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:58,059
they function very much like the Masons

251
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:00,079
or some street gang.

252
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,085
Evil!

253
00:12:03,084 --> 00:12:05,055
Evil! Evil!

254
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:06,032
Evil man!

255
00:12:06,032 --> 00:12:07,014
Why am I an evil man?

256
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:08,086
Did you or did you not hear a man saying

257
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:10,086
if you have a source leaving one bug, you will be

258
00:12:10,086 --> 00:12:11,063
in here at 1:30.

259
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,003
I thought it was 2:30

260
00:12:14,032 --> 00:12:15,079
Now you're evil and stupid.

261
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:16,044
(laughs)

262
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:18,000
You now that, I'm actually just in a different time zone.

263
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,015
I thought stupidity was an excuse though.

264
00:12:20,046 --> 00:12:22,091
A lot of people at Netscape don't get out much

265
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:25,012
because they're at work all the time but

266
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:27,045
most of people's social interaction I would expect is

267
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:29,045
revolves around work just because

268
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:31,091
so many people spend so much of their time at work.

269
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:33,039
Hi Chris, it's Tara

270
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:35,008
um, how much do you love me?

271
00:12:36,032 --> 00:12:37,003
Good.

272
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:38,067
What do you know about way the threading stuff

273
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:41,003
that falls into Javascript stuff and Java makes it feed?

274
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,091
All we have left to hold on to, really

275
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:46,008
is the work place, I mean it is the modern village.

276
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,030
People get to know your history

277
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,035
they shrug at your bad jokes.

278
00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:55,071
There's a kind of familiarity that

279
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:58,037
and continuity that we don't have elsewhere.

280
00:12:58,037 --> 00:12:59,048
Paul

281
00:12:59,048 --> 00:13:02,000
we're going  go out in a while and get something to eat

282
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,040
and do stupid things. You're interested?

283
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,085
Sure. Sure. Right.

284
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:09,008
Ok, the purpose of this meeting is not to beat up people

285
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:11,023
the purpose of this meeting is to make sure that

286
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,065
as a company we are incredibly focused on

287
00:13:13,065 --> 00:13:15,039
getting the bug count to 0

288
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:18,075
we've been moderately focused up until now

289
00:13:18,075 --> 00:13:20,091
we need to be deadly focused

290
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,063
from here on in.

291
00:13:21,063 --> 00:13:24,053
Ok Jeff Weinstein

292
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,053
is he in this room?

293
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,083
He's not in this room.

294
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,023
Did not check-in this weekend, true or false?

295
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:32,079
He did not check-in this weekend

296
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,091
He did not answer his mail

297
00:13:33,091 --> 00:13:35,048
and he hasn't answered his phone yet either.

298
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,084
His locator shows he's with the rest of the colonists

299
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:39,084
(laughs)

300
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:42,051
The old saying is that trying to manage programmers

301
00:13:42,051 --> 00:13:44,051
is like trying to herd cats.

302
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:46,051
You know you want them to be cats

303
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:49,028
if you like cats, I mean 'cause you want what's unique about

304
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,067
that creature

305
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:54,022
But they really don't all like to go in the same direction.

306
00:13:55,024 --> 00:13:56,091
In less than four years

307
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:59,041
Netscape has grown from a handful of people

308
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,072
to over 200

309
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,087
and sometimes, locating a programmer

310
00:14:02,087 --> 00:14:04,036
become yet another obstacle

311
00:14:04,036 --> 00:14:06,022
for the browser team to overcome.

312
00:14:06,022 --> 00:14:07,036
I'd say he's not in there.

313
00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:09,071
That would be my guess, straight out.

314
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:11,021
He's not there.

315
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:14,003
When's the last time he was in here?

316
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:15,015
This afternoon.

317
00:14:15,015 --> 00:14:16,075
Ok

318
00:14:16,075 --> 00:14:19,089
Tara and I are ready to take a hit out on him.

319
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:22,070
and well if ya see him when he comes back tell him to

320
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,072
panic and run around and we're like

321
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,066
doomed on Mac right now with this thing.

322
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:27,076
Doomed!

323
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:31,032
The person working on Mac is like waiting for data right?

324
00:14:31,032 --> 00:14:34,049
You should go around to every person in the company saying, "Doomed!"

325
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:39,047
Netscape predicament has much to do with this man

326
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:42,015
Bill Gates, whose company, Microsoft

327
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,015
has made him the richest, and arguably

328
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:46,015
the most powerful man in the world.

329
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,071
Allright if we can have order we'd like to begin.

330
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:51,041
Viewing Netscape's browser

331
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,078
as a potential threat to his computing empire

332
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:55,045
Gates has moved swiftly,

333
00:14:55,045 --> 00:14:57,017
making his own browser free

334
00:14:57,065 --> 00:14:58,096
and Netscape claims,

335
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:01,067
also engaging an unfair business practices

336
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,067
to take away its customers.

337
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:05,017
But we need to explore today

338
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:06,067
whether you and your company

339
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:08,020
have crossed the line

340
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,087
or on the other hand

341
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:12,048
whether this is just the carping of disgruntled rivals.

342
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:15,004
Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale

343
00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:17,041
argues his company's case before the Senate.

344
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,051
And certainly nobody here on this panel is

345
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,088
a greater admirer of Mr. Gates

346
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:22,029
or his company than I am.

347
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:24,012
But we do ask that Microsoft

348
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:25,008
be held accountable

349
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,000
for some of their actions.

350
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:29,037
Actions that intimidate PC OEM manufacturers

351
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:32,039
to use their products and exclusionary practises

352
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:34,033
that prevent them from using my products.

353
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,033
Not all companies succeed.

354
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:38,053
Some fail to embrace change.

355
00:15:39,012 --> 00:15:42,075
This is the way technology in the free market works.

356
00:15:43,014 --> 00:15:45,051
The software industry's success

357
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:48,039
has not been driven by government regulation

358
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:51,067
but by freedom and the basic human desire

359
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:54,036
to learn, to innovate and to excel.

360
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,050
Meanwhile thousand of miles away

361
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:59,050
Netscape programmers continue working around the clock

362
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,063
in a race to meet Mozilla's release date.

363
00:16:02,015 --> 00:16:04,060
These guys they tend to work very consistently,

364
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,086
so they'll just keep working until it's done and they won't stop.

365
00:16:07,021 --> 00:16:09,004
They don't need food, they don't need sleep,

366
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:10,000
they don't need anything

367
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,012
OK, so they take pay, but...

368
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,004
A while ago some people from Harvard came and said

369
00:16:17,004 --> 00:16:19,004
"Well how do you develop software, we're writing a book" and I

370
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:20,064
and I talked about all the things I thought

371
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:22,000
were really important and they were just

372
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,020
it felt to me like they were shaking their heads going,

373
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,024
Oh, gee, he doesn't know about Principle 7

374
00:16:26,024 --> 00:16:28,003
and oh, he doesn't know about Principle 22

375
00:16:28,003 --> 00:16:30,057
and in some ways they're right... I really haven't got a clue.

376
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:33,037
Right I really like to err on the side of

377
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:35,061
every day we wake up in the morning and say

378
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,072
based on what I know today

379
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:40,075
what's the best way to get to where we all want to go?

380
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:44,005
I personally or me and you three of us

381
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:46,083
do no have time to read all two millions of source code

382
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:49,024
to see that, there are no remaining problems.

383
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,055
We're going over here

384
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,087
zeroing in on Jeff Weinstein.

385
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:59,001
With March 31st only days away

386
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:01,078
the team can't proceed until Jeff Weinstein

387
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:04,089
an expert on some of Netscapes most arcane code

388
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,069
finds time to complete the bug fixes on his list.

389
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,059
How are you doing?

390
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:09,036
OK

391
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:10,059
Alright well

392
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:12,027
you are officially the most doomed

393
00:17:12,027 --> 00:17:14,027
individual in the company sir

394
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:21,048
this one I can close, same with this one

395
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:23,048
yeah bunch of these

396
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:26,010
Um hopefully I'll get most of it done tonight

397
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,002
His goal he was just going to stay all night

398
00:17:28,002 --> 00:17:29,044
and he was going to get it all done.

399
00:17:29,044 --> 00:17:31,066
The good news is actually I think by about

400
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:34,010
I'm not sure if it was 9 or 11 o'clock at night

401
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,010
he actually was completely done.

402
00:17:38,051 --> 00:17:40,020
Yeah!

403
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,068
Reaching a critical milestone

404
00:17:41,068 --> 00:17:43,072
is cause for celebration.

405
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:49,009
And one bug left

406
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:51,006
and it's a really really hard one

407
00:17:51,006 --> 00:17:53,027
Don't make me kill you, close 4330.

408
00:17:53,027 --> 00:17:54,092
I will close 4330.

409
00:17:56,024 --> 00:17:57,063
Bug count is small

410
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:00,000
there are some bugs that are not currently closed

411
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,048
but most of them are like piddly little annoying things that

412
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,057
Some of its stuck!

413
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,075
All praise the uh the mighty ones that created tremendous pile of

414
00:18:12,075 --> 00:18:16,020
people working really hard this week to do the impossible.

415
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,088
There is this magic phrase that Michael Toy invented

416
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:22,088
which is "Zarro Boogs", hum

417
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:24,067
which is it's not quite perfect

418
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:26,000
but it's perfect enough

419
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,054
as zero bugs / "zarro boogs".

420
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:30,045
Do you have a spare monitor upstairs?

421
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,022
Yes I do have a spare monitor.

422
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:34,014
This is the first big test

423
00:18:34,027 --> 00:18:37,068
Will an outsider actually be able to make Mozilla work?

424
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:42,008
If not Netscape stands a good chance of missing its March 31st deadline

425
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:43,081
I thought it's gonna be huge thing,

426
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,051
I thought it's gonna be like a hundred,

427
00:18:44,051 --> 00:18:46,074
two hundred people here like all and rows

428
00:18:46,074 --> 00:18:49,052
like with soviet style.

429
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:51,052
We are nowhere near that organized

430
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:55,038
Looks like it's all here, here we go!

431
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:00,041
Wow! All good, it's pretty simple how stuff is built.

432
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:03,017
It's just there's set of scripts that are set up

433
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,024
to say exactly what to compile and then

434
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:08,025
they all get globbed together into Mozilla hopefully.

435
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,071
- Here it is
- Yeah

436
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:14,072
If you get it to work, then it means anybody can get it to work.

437
00:19:14,072 --> 00:19:15,050
That's true.

438
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:28,039
(WILD CHEERING clapping laughter)

439
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:34,034
- And look It has an about face!
- ...Look it's so cute...

440
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:39,011
- Oh, that was pretty

441
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,058
- Yeah it's...
- No, I don't think it's working.

442
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:44,048
- Well go to the..
- Well
- Oh...
- Big crash...

443
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:46,048
- Hell shot the foot...

444
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:51,008
It's actually going really well.

445
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:52,050
I didn't think we'd actually get somebody

446
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,061
to build this quickly.

447
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:56,059
We had to do one small adjustment and it worked!

448
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,072
With the source almost ready to ship,

449
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,075
Netscape must explain the significance

450
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,034
of Mozilla to the press.

451
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:06,047
Basically what we wanna do is we wanna give them a little bit of the history

452
00:20:07,031 --> 00:20:11,085
and then we wanna go into the what's actually going to happen tomorrow.

453
00:20:11,098 --> 00:20:14,035
The other important take away then too from this

454
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:20,008
is that this is a really exciting cool thing.

455
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:24,079
- Good afternoon, Forrester
- Hi Stan Dolberg and uh Eric Brown please.

456
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,004
- One second.

457
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:31,075
- You've reached voicemail for Stan Dolberg -- I'll transfer you now

458
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:33,091
- Good afternoon, Forrester.

459
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:35,024
- Hi this is Maggie Young.

460
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:37,005
I'm calling from Netscape and I have scheduled

461
00:20:37,005 --> 00:20:39,067
conference call with Stan Dolberg and Eric Brown

462
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:41,071
and I just got Stan's voicemail.

463
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:44,095
Netscape hopes the press will greet Mozilla with the same enthusiasm

464
00:20:44,095 --> 00:20:48,034
it had for the company in its early days.

465
00:20:48,034 --> 00:20:53,038
At eleven AM this morning, Netscape's stock went public and Wall Street went bonkers.

466
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,013
Initially offer had a price of 38 $ a share,

467
00:20:56,013 --> 00:20:58,040
Netscape shut up to 72 within minutes...

468
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,085
The stock is bid up at extraordinary levels

469
00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:05,003
in the first couple of really days and weeks

470
00:21:05,003 --> 00:21:06,051
of its introduction.

471
00:21:06,051 --> 00:21:09,028
It is the biggest initial public offering

472
00:21:09,028 --> 00:21:11,090
in basically the Wall Street history.

473
00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:17,072
- Good afternoon, Forrester

474
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,031
- Hi this is Josh Walker.

475
00:21:20,031 --> 00:21:24,007
Today less than three years after its record breaking IPO however,

476
00:21:24,007 --> 00:21:27,002
Netscape's story generates a different response.

477
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:28,013
- Hi there
- Yup

478
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:30,076
- As you now tomorrow is March 31st

479
00:21:30,076 --> 00:21:33,080
- So that means hum, source code will be made

480
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,080
available to the developer community.

481
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,081
And we thought we would just

482
00:21:36,081 --> 00:21:38,075
catch you up to speed and walk you through

483
00:21:38,075 --> 00:21:41,005
that and see if you had some questions.

484
00:21:41,005 --> 00:21:45,058
- Either I'm braindead or it takes lot of effort to communicate

485
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:49,050
and so I'm concerned that while you all know

486
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:53,039
what it means, I'm not confident

487
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,083
that it's coming across to the press.

488
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,064
- Right, I think those are good points.

489
00:21:58,064 --> 00:22:02,033
By opening up the source code, we basically extend our developer community

490
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:04,027
from those folks that are inside of Netscape

491
00:22:04,027 --> 00:22:05,081
to hundreds and thousands of developers

492
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:06,086
outside of Netscape

493
00:22:06,086 --> 00:22:09,073
so it's no longer Netscape versus Microsoft.

494
00:22:09,073 --> 00:22:12,011
It's Netscape and all of the Netscape,

495
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:13,088
you know, virtual community.

496
00:22:13,088 --> 00:22:17,030
- I think there is a belief that Netscape

497
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,002
doesn't have a position to continue

498
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:21,085
to compete with Microsoft

499
00:22:21,085 --> 00:22:24,051
in the browser front and that

500
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,083
in essence you've given up on the browser position.

501
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:35,050
This was a lot more smooth than I had originally anticipated.

502
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,023
Really.

503
00:22:38,026 --> 00:22:40,072
I'm still waiting for the major bump in the road

504
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:42,033
that's gonna happen some time between now

505
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:43,055
and tomorrow afternoon.

506
00:22:43,055 --> 00:22:45,014
In software development there is

507
00:22:45,014 --> 00:22:46,057
always a bump in the road.

508
00:22:46,057 --> 00:22:48,057
We just want to hear the Apple story

509
00:22:48,057 --> 00:22:53,094
They just can't quite get themselves comfortable

510
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:55,098
with the patent grant or with

511
00:22:55,098 --> 00:22:58,033
whatever we tried to do to fix it for them.

512
00:22:58,033 --> 00:23:01,043
So the last thing back out of their lawyer was

513
00:23:01,043 --> 00:23:04,025
"gee, oh I don't know that we get enough protection."

514
00:23:04,025 --> 00:23:09,008
Mozilla has a small piece of code from Apple that has not been cleared for public license.

515
00:23:09,017 --> 00:23:11,001
- Ok.
- We have to escalate.

516
00:23:11,076 --> 00:23:13,046
- Hi this is Mark Andreeson,

517
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:16,044
I called a few minutes ago, and left message

518
00:23:16,044 --> 00:23:18,066
we're trying to get - the problem is I can't get phone

519
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:19,092
there's no one at the Apple switchboard

520
00:23:19,092 --> 00:23:21,092
so I'm having a hard time getting phone numbers for people.

521
00:23:21,092 --> 00:23:22,085
Awesome.

522
00:23:24,074 --> 00:23:26,025
Hold on, 6 2 0.

523
00:23:35,002 --> 00:23:37,029
In order to ship Mozilla the next morning,

524
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:39,010
Scott Collins is called in

525
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,036
to replace Apple's code with his own invention.

526
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:43,088
And theoretically we believe this is possible.

527
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:47,033
It's my last bug. When I complete this bug,

528
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:50,090
I will be allowed to rest.

529
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:53,075
So I stayed up until about 5:40,

530
00:23:53,075 --> 00:23:56,073
this morning writing this replacement class.

531
00:23:56,073 --> 00:23:59,036
It made my life a living hell.

532
00:23:59,036 --> 00:24:01,039
I got it basically running, it's all running,

533
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,028
it's all really good, and thank heavens

534
00:24:03,028 --> 00:24:04,094
we got permission from Apple

535
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:06,029
to ship the regular source.

536
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,023
It's my understanding that Jamie

537
00:24:08,023 --> 00:24:10,072
is gonna be the person that's gonna be pushing

538
00:24:10,072 --> 00:24:13,039
the bits up to the website at around 10:00,

539
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,066
is that correct?

540
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:15,075
OK.

541
00:24:15,075 --> 00:24:18,013
And we're gonna be staging some different

542
00:24:18,013 --> 00:24:20,057
photo opportunities for the press at that time,

543
00:24:20,057 --> 00:24:23,015
there will be television cameras you know news crews

544
00:24:23,015 --> 00:24:25,086
- Couldn't we just like hire actors to do this for us?

545
00:24:25,086 --> 00:24:30,099
- ...just tell them they get to be on TV come on..
- We're not gonna mandate it..

546
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:33,075
- You're on TV right now.
- We've been on TV for two months.

547
00:24:33,075 --> 00:24:37,024
- I don't think anyone is gonna come.

548
00:24:42,035 --> 00:24:44,031
One way to learn to run a marathon

549
00:24:44,031 --> 00:24:47,060
is put a person out 26 miles into the desert,

550
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,097
and say, you know, there's this bomb on your back

551
00:24:49,097 --> 00:24:51,075
that's gonna go off in a certain length of time

552
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:53,019
if you don't get into the town.

553
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:55,022
Well, that'll motivate you to get in

554
00:24:55,022 --> 00:24:57,030
but there is a certain chance that you'll be blown up.

555
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,082
- You know what time it is?
- Yeah it's five to ten.

556
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:04,010
- Aah! Going to be late. Hurry up!

557
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,094
Welcome everybody to the conference call.

558
00:25:05,094 --> 00:25:07,063
Thanks for joining us this morning.

559
00:25:07,063 --> 00:25:09,063
Today Netscape announced that

560
00:25:09,063 --> 00:25:12,047
the first developer release of its Communicator 5.0

561
00:25:12,047 --> 00:25:14,091
source code is available for download

562
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:17,011
from the Mozilla dot org website.

563
00:25:19,022 --> 00:25:21,008
- You know where Tara is?

564
00:25:21,008 --> 00:25:22,084
- Second floor?

565
00:25:22,084 --> 00:25:25,048
- It's first floor, way on the other side.

566
00:25:25,048 --> 00:25:27,017
And then today on the end of March,

567
00:25:27,017 --> 00:25:29,044
as we announced, we are pushing the code

568
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:30,059
out to the Web as they say,

569
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,004
and we are delighted to be part of it

570
00:25:32,004 --> 00:25:33,078
and we're very excited to see what happens.

571
00:25:33,078 --> 00:25:36,025
The good news is the marathoner is now

572
00:25:36,025 --> 00:25:38,011
coming into town with that bomb on his back

573
00:25:38,011 --> 00:25:39,036
and it looks like he's gonna make it.

574
00:25:43,095 --> 00:25:45,067
- This is the moment of truth!

575
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,055
They don't have theoretical framework

576
00:25:48,055 --> 00:25:50,063
to write software, they're just writing it.

577
00:25:55,031 --> 00:25:56,096
It's just like hitting the baseball.

578
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,091
If their code gets a home run,

579
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:01,049
nobody's asking questions.

580
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:02,092
Well, this doesn't make sense,

581
00:26:02,092 --> 00:26:04,045
or why do you that, why does it work.

582
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:05,080
Nobody cares why it works.

583
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:20,084
- Wait this is bad.
- What's that?

584
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,073
- Well it's not connecting to...
- The machine that controls

585
00:26:25,073 --> 00:26:28,027
the FTP push is, like, not answering.

586
00:26:28,027 --> 00:26:30,053
- Is it loaded?
- It's "blast" not "blash".

587
00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:33,048
- Oh
- Yeah maybe they're...

588
00:26:37,072 --> 00:26:40,061
- Mac's there. UNIX is there. Windows is there.
- We're done!

589
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:44,051
- It's on!
- Yeah!

590
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:58,025
- Since Jamie is here, I am told that means

591
00:26:58,025 --> 00:27:00,057
that we have now pushed the source out on the Net.

592
00:27:00,057 --> 00:27:01,040
Is that correct?

593
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,001
- Actually, we decided not to.

594
00:27:05,068 --> 00:27:07,090
We thought it was a stupid idea.

595
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:12,095
- That's our story and were sticking to it.

596
00:27:25,016 --> 00:27:27,052
For a moment, everyone at Netscape

597
00:27:27,052 --> 00:27:28,080
takes a breather.

598
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,082
- I think it's gonna work out.

599
00:27:31,053 --> 00:27:33,066
In the first hour of its release,

600
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:36,052
the source code is downloaded thousands of times

601
00:27:36,052 --> 00:27:38,071
but the number of downloads is no guarantee

602
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:41,066
that Netscape will receive enough valuable contributions

603
00:27:41,066 --> 00:27:44,013
to help the company to reverse its slide.

604
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:50,040
He's known as Pavlov to me. He's Pavlov at

605
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,049
Pavlov.net, on IRC he's Pavlov or Pav or

606
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:57,038
um, Pav Sleeping, or Pav Tired Up Too Late.

607
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:00,054
And um without him I think we'd be months behind.

608
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:03,043
Netscape's notoriety draws code writers

609
00:28:03,043 --> 00:28:06,079
from around the world willing to work on Mozilla without pay.

610
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:10,050
One such contributor comes from rural Georgia.

611
00:28:12,072 --> 00:28:15,020
I've been amazed over the last two or three years,

612
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,042
when especially his mother would come tell me

613
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:19,068
"Well, so and so called" from maybe New York

614
00:28:19,068 --> 00:28:21,009
and they were coming to Atlanta

615
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:22,099
and they wanted to talk to Stuart or see him,

616
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:24,074
and they were gonna go down and have lunch.

617
00:28:24,074 --> 00:28:26,092
"Well", I'd say "Who is this person from New York?"

618
00:28:26,092 --> 00:28:29,067
And the all of a sudden "Well, he's been working

619
00:28:29,067 --> 00:28:32,004
with Stuart on some programming issues

620
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:34,026
for a year or so and he wanted to come down

621
00:28:34,026 --> 00:28:37,074
and meet. "Well, did you tell him you're only sixteen?"

622
00:28:37,074 --> 00:28:41,007
I had no idea. Um, and that's great,

623
00:28:41,007 --> 00:28:43,003
that's a wonderful thing because

624
00:28:43,003 --> 00:28:47,060
he's contributing. It doesn't matter that he's young.

625
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:51,000
The place we call the cave. We just shut the door

626
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,015
and this is where he does whatever he does.

627
00:28:55,015 --> 00:28:58,081
It is flabbergasting to think that your child

628
00:28:58,081 --> 00:29:03,077
has done something for this worldwide company

629
00:29:03,077 --> 00:29:05,010
instead of his homework.

630
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,031
I went and looked back at the older code

631
00:29:08,031 --> 00:29:11,021
and I was really frightened by how

632
00:29:11,021 --> 00:29:14,009
incredibly messy and just awful the code looked.

633
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:15,098
It would have taken you know

634
00:29:15,098 --> 00:29:18,026
years to try and figure out what it was doing.

635
00:29:18,026 --> 00:29:21,025
So we basically did it from scratch.

636
00:29:21,098 --> 00:29:24,038
Pretty much I'm providing the code that makes

637
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:26,058
the browser show everything faster

638
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:29,020
and more efficiently than it used to.

639
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:33,000
His keyboarding is almost just like talking.

640
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,011
It's just um, an expression.

641
00:29:36,011 --> 00:29:38,063
He can express himself that way

642
00:29:38,063 --> 00:29:42,082
and it's just totally unconscious, almost.

643
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:45,088
Just a part of how he communicates.

644
00:29:46,068 --> 00:29:49,063
In the past, free code contributions

645
00:29:49,063 --> 00:29:51,022
helped build the Internet.

646
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,015
How commercial enterprise would benefit

647
00:29:53,015 --> 00:29:55,074
from free code remains a big question.

648
00:29:55,074 --> 00:29:57,066
Well, it's certainly my hope that

649
00:29:57,066 --> 00:30:00,075
the enormous amount of new people

650
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:02,011
that no one company could afford

651
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:03,094
to have working on any product,

652
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:06,066
now contributing to the Netscape Navigator

653
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:09,056
Communicator will make a significant difference

654
00:30:09,056 --> 00:30:11,027
in the improvement of the product.

655
00:30:11,027 --> 00:30:14,072
How that works against any competitor,

656
00:30:14,072 --> 00:30:16,025
remains to be seen.

657
00:30:25,098 --> 00:30:27,076
-Good morning
-Good morning, Thank you.

658
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:31,005
David Readerman an analyst for San Francisco Investment Bank,

659
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:33,055
closely monitors Netscape's radical plan

660
00:30:33,055 --> 00:30:35,031
for investors eager to participate

661
00:30:35,031 --> 00:30:37,004
in the Internet stock boom.

662
00:30:38,013 --> 00:30:40,043
The market is really kind of a voting machine,

663
00:30:40,043 --> 00:30:43,021
it's voting yes I believe that vision statement.

664
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:46,050
Yes I believe that's gonna result in products sales.

665
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,071
Yes that's going to drive earnings up, and

666
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:50,071
you know stocks should traded accordingly.

667
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,025
The financial benefits to Netscape of

668
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:55,095
giving away its source code are hard to measure.

669
00:30:55,095 --> 00:30:58,039
I understand why Netscape's trying to do it.

670
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:02,026
They still have to show me that

671
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,069
behind the vision and the slideware,

672
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:08,046
there's a real sustainable business model

673
00:31:08,046 --> 00:31:11,013
that can deliver earnings hum,

674
00:31:11,013 --> 00:31:14,055
and so I'm in show-me mode for Netscape.

675
00:31:20,057 --> 00:31:22,093
Now, my job will be three times

676
00:31:22,093 --> 00:31:25,088
as hard as it was yesterday and it was already ten times harder than it needed to be.

677
00:31:25,088 --> 00:31:29,005
Right? Did I just work really hard to ship

678
00:31:29,005 --> 00:31:31,013
the company jewels out of the building and

679
00:31:31,013 --> 00:31:33,020
it's just gonna end in us dying

680
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,052
and rolling in poison and misery.

681
00:31:35,052 --> 00:31:37,046
The day after this stuff goes out,

682
00:31:37,046 --> 00:31:38,058
you really don't get to let up.

683
00:31:38,058 --> 00:31:41,015
There is then the sort of day in day out,

684
00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:45,008
go to work turn on the computer, code, code code.

685
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:46,094
- Thanks Tara.

686
00:31:49,046 --> 00:31:50,053
- Tara?

687
00:31:50,068 --> 00:31:52,095
- Yeah what's your doctor say Tara?

688
00:31:52,095 --> 00:31:55,081
- Uh, my doctor says interestingly enough

689
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:59,081
that I work too much

690
00:31:59,081 --> 00:32:02,025
and uh, that if I went to work today after

691
00:32:02,025 --> 00:32:04,047
my appointment he would personally kill me.

692
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:07,075
I have an agreement with myself

693
00:32:07,075 --> 00:32:10,002
that by the time I'm 35, I'm either going

694
00:32:10,002 --> 00:32:11,084
to be high school teacher or bartender,

695
00:32:11,084 --> 00:32:13,095
but something, anything other than a

696
00:32:13,095 --> 00:32:16,007
in a position in the hightech industry,

697
00:32:16,007 --> 00:32:18,011
otherwise I'll probably die by the time I'm 40.

698
00:32:25,073 --> 00:32:27,046
Uh, now that I'm an old guy

699
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:28,058
I've kind of been round the block

700
00:32:28,058 --> 00:32:32,084
couple times and you can go from realizing,

701
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:34,049
"This just never stops, does it?"

702
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:37,022
And that being really depressing

703
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:38,092
because you feel like it "I'm on, I'm on".

704
00:32:38,092 --> 00:32:40,068
I said I was never going to be on the treadmill

705
00:32:40,068 --> 00:32:42,060
and here I am. I'm on the treadmill.

706
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,084
I'm going to be running like this forever.

707
00:32:44,084 --> 00:32:46,098
Because they're good at software,

708
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:48,094
they need to keep pace.

709
00:32:48,094 --> 00:32:51,005
And as a result, keeping pace means

710
00:32:51,005 --> 00:32:53,090
to shut a lot of other things out.

711
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,059
They just don't have time to read,

712
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:57,014
time to hear about the world.

713
00:32:57,014 --> 00:32:59,008
They don't have much time for their families.

714
00:32:59,008 --> 00:33:00,082
Um, but when you're in situation where

715
00:33:00,082 --> 00:33:02,080
you really have a lot of work to do

716
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,008
and no time to do it,

717
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:07,003
you know, you pick what you want.

718
00:33:07,003 --> 00:33:08,076
Some people pick wanting to have a family.

719
00:33:08,076 --> 00:33:10,001
Some people pick wanting to

720
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:11,011
get some software done.

721
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,079
Christopher was born right after I started at Netscape,

722
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,034
and I basically missed the first

723
00:33:19,034 --> 00:33:21,071
two years of his life because of the intensity.

724
00:33:21,071 --> 00:33:23,052
I'd work 'til about 7 or 8 o'clock,

725
00:33:23,052 --> 00:33:25,027
come home, eat dinner,

726
00:33:25,027 --> 00:33:28,051
put the kids to bed, and then go back to work,

727
00:33:28,051 --> 00:33:30,039
or work from home, until 2 or 3

728
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:32,057
in the morning, and was like the Dad zombie.

729
00:33:32,057 --> 00:33:35,016
He would call and say, I'm on my way home

730
00:33:35,016 --> 00:33:37,002
and then it would be 2 or 3 hours and

731
00:33:37,002 --> 00:33:39,029
you know, the romantic dinner candles

732
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:40,009
had burned down

733
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:41,069
and I was thinking he was dead

734
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:43,001
by the side of the road so,

735
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:45,015
you know if 24 hours goes by

736
00:33:45,015 --> 00:33:47,010
and I don't hear from him,

737
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,059
that I pretty much know where to find him.

738
00:33:50,045 --> 00:33:53,008
I live in Michigan. And I commute.

739
00:33:53,008 --> 00:33:55,052
So it's quite a long commute,

740
00:33:55,052 --> 00:33:57,023
I don't make it every day.

741
00:33:57,023 --> 00:33:59,050
I only make it about every two weeks or so.

742
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:03,048
But um, It is quite a time change.

743
00:34:03,048 --> 00:34:06,028
Here it's something like 12:01

744
00:34:06,028 --> 00:34:09,032
in the morning, and there it's 1954.

745
00:34:15,071 --> 00:34:18,042
The motivation from moving back here is

746
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:21,013
I wanted to get into a community,

747
00:34:21,013 --> 00:34:25,021
put roots down, and you know, feel settled.

748
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:28,090
And I...Life is just different out there,

749
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:31,096
it really is. I mean here people like worked

750
00:34:31,096 --> 00:34:36,000
car factory or whatever... thirty years and out.

751
00:34:38,094 --> 00:34:42,001
We spent, like, 45 minutes talking about all his

752
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:44,090
like, his whole story, from job, to job, to job, to job.

753
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,021
I thought it was pretty cool.

754
00:34:47,071 --> 00:34:53,032
He had like ten or something, jobs.

755
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:56,076
He seemed to do it a lot during particularly peak

756
00:34:56,076 --> 00:34:59,048
stressful times, like, you know, baby due

757
00:34:59,048 --> 00:35:01,044
in two months, I'm changing jobs now, dear.

758
00:35:01,044 --> 00:35:03,021
I like when everything is changing.

759
00:35:03,021 --> 00:35:05,096
That makes it's exciting. That's why I do it.

760
00:35:05,096 --> 00:35:08,011
It's something to be in the storm,

761
00:35:08,011 --> 00:35:11,040
right in the middle of it and seeing everything

762
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,038
new happening and putting it all together.

763
00:35:13,038 --> 00:35:14,019
It's really exciting.

764
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:18,007
It's almost addictive. I wouldn't want to leave it,

765
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:20,005
that's for sure.

766
00:35:20,005 --> 00:35:22,019
At times, it's a clear sacrifice

767
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,051
of elements of your personal life.

768
00:35:26,011 --> 00:35:28,021
I have to work very hard but I have

769
00:35:28,021 --> 00:35:30,076
the chance of being rewarded for my efforts.

770
00:35:30,076 --> 00:35:33,009
This disadvantage, my life's moving on.

771
00:35:33,009 --> 00:35:34,092
I don't have any children yet,

772
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:36,038
you realize there's a certain amount of

773
00:35:36,038 --> 00:35:39,015
my life that I'm sacrificing I'm going to look back

774
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:41,003
and a portion of this life is gone.

775
00:35:43,009 --> 00:35:46,028
In the U.S., we have at least several million people

776
00:35:46,028 --> 00:35:49,005
directly making a living from software.

777
00:35:49,005 --> 00:35:51,001
And it's the fastest growing group of

778
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:52,044
people in the economy.

779
00:35:52,044 --> 00:35:55,025
And it's certainly in aggregate,

780
00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:57,082
the highest paying field of its size.

781
00:35:57,082 --> 00:35:59,063
I mean yeah, you've got baseball,

782
00:35:59,063 --> 00:36:00,094
you've got Hollywood.

783
00:36:00,094 --> 00:36:02,094
But you know when you really

784
00:36:02,094 --> 00:36:05,015
think of a group that has millions of people in it,

785
00:36:05,015 --> 00:36:06,084
these are the highest wages anybody

786
00:36:06,084 --> 00:36:08,032
has ever seen in the United States.

787
00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:16,073
The opportunity to win big

788
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:19,078
for code writers is very real.

789
00:36:19,078 --> 00:36:23,065
In fact, that if you will jackpot

790
00:36:23,065 --> 00:36:26,023
opportunity is reflected here on a

791
00:36:26,023 --> 00:36:27,078
Wall Street trading desk.

792
00:36:27,078 --> 00:36:31,007
And I find that a lot of the engineers

793
00:36:31,007 --> 00:36:33,040
and managers from Silicon Valley

794
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,051
are very attuned to what goes on

795
00:36:35,051 --> 00:36:38,046
on these trading floors daily.

796
00:36:38,046 --> 00:36:42,009
By one account, 64 millionaires are created daily

797
00:36:42,009 --> 00:36:44,069
in Sillicon Valley where any technology worker

798
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,086
can striking rich over night.

799
00:36:46,086 --> 00:36:49,001
You join a company and they give you

800
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:51,032
some stock options which basically says,

801
00:36:51,032 --> 00:36:53,061
rather than just giving you stock,

802
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,026
they give the right to buy the stock

803
00:36:55,026 --> 00:36:57,086
in the future at the current price.

804
00:36:57,086 --> 00:37:03,001
You might get stock in the order of

805
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:05,036
maybe a year's salary or

806
00:37:05,036 --> 00:37:07,080
two years salary typically, worth of options.

807
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,092
In some of these real booming companies

808
00:37:10,092 --> 00:37:12,096
out there on the Internet, the potential for

809
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,078
becoming a millionaire or doing very well,

810
00:37:14,078 --> 00:37:15,080
is very, very high.

811
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,034
The people who were very,

812
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:19,065
very early, they call them "Mozillionaires".

813
00:37:19,065 --> 00:37:21,021
Stock options are a con.

814
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:24,009
Um, it's a carrot and dangle, it's like,

815
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:25,044
oh well, you know if you'll give up

816
00:37:25,044 --> 00:37:26,050
your one and only youth,

817
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,007
maybe someday you'll make money, right...

818
00:37:29,007 --> 00:37:31,046
it's um, I've known so many people

819
00:37:31,046 --> 00:37:33,073
who have gambled on start-up lottery

820
00:37:33,073 --> 00:37:34,096
and got nothing.

821
00:37:34,096 --> 00:37:37,094
You know it's just like lottery ticket, it's a stupid tax.

822
00:37:37,094 --> 00:37:41,096
Um, I happened to win that particular lottery.

823
00:37:41,096 --> 00:37:43,088
From the day Microsoft announced

824
00:37:43,088 --> 00:37:46,032
its aggressive commitment to the Internet, however,

825
00:37:46,032 --> 00:37:49,003
Netscape stock has been in steady decline,

826
00:37:49,003 --> 00:37:51,061
and throughout most of 1998 Netscape

827
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:54,036
options are essentially worthless.

828
00:37:54,036 --> 00:37:55,053
A year and a half ago,

829
00:37:55,053 --> 00:37:57,063
half of our revenue came from browser sales.

830
00:37:57,063 --> 00:37:59,015
Today none of it does, so well,

831
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:01,026
Any business person out there knows

832
00:38:01,026 --> 00:38:02,034
that that's a huge challenge.

833
00:38:02,034 --> 00:38:04,048
I mean let me take your number one selling product

834
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:05,076
away from you and you replace that

835
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:07,001
within period of 12 months or so.

836
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:08,067
Not many people want to do that.

837
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:11,046
Even though the company sells other Internet products,

838
00:38:11,046 --> 00:38:14,036
the marketplace views Netscape as a browser company

839
00:38:14,036 --> 00:38:16,063
in a losing battle with Microsoft.

840
00:38:18,023 --> 00:38:22,053
- Greg this is Jim Barksdale with Netscape Communications, how are you?

841
00:38:22,088 --> 00:38:24,098
It's clear that Netscape doesn't have

842
00:38:24,098 --> 00:38:27,073
enough pieces to threaten Microsoft.

843
00:38:27,073 --> 00:38:30,065
I don't think that Netscape long term

844
00:38:30,065 --> 00:38:33,032
can survive as an independent company.

845
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:39,028
While Mozilla tries to recapture the early,

846
00:38:39,028 --> 00:38:41,061
glory days of the company,

847
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:44,005
integrating code from the outside means

848
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:46,048
more work for everyone on the browser team.

849
00:38:46,048 --> 00:38:47,090
- Apparently I must have done it backwards

850
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:50,063
from what you told me, or I don't know what

851
00:38:50,063 --> 00:38:52,063
- Ok, then this is bad.

852
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,088
- We want to take the old free tree

853
00:38:54,088 --> 00:38:56,061
and use it as subsection,

854
00:38:56,061 --> 00:38:59,042
and we want to build this interesting tree around this.

855
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:00,028
- No that's not want we want to do

856
00:39:00,028 --> 00:39:01,063
NS Private at the top, right?

857
00:39:01,063 --> 00:39:04,005
- A project file for this or project file for that,

858
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:05,050
it can't be a project file for both.

859
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,094
We don't have a plan for doing both.

860
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:10,009
So right now I have some files that have

861
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:12,019
to come from here for Java in a single directory,

862
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,032
and some files that have to come from here

863
00:39:13,032 --> 00:39:15,042
in the same directory, the same directory.

864
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:16,030
Tell me how I do that?

865
00:39:19,096 --> 00:39:21,038
That's the problem.

866
00:39:21,038 --> 00:39:23,071
The browser division which costs the company

867
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:26,023
almost 30 million dollars a year to operate

868
00:39:26,023 --> 00:39:28,065
and contributes few revenues to the company

869
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:31,015
is reorganized in the fall for the second time

870
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:32,017
in less than a year.

871
00:39:32,017 --> 00:39:33,076
Do we have all the answers: No.

872
00:39:33,076 --> 00:39:35,046
We're going to try and learn what we can from

873
00:39:35,046 --> 00:39:37,019
seeing the people who've done this well...

874
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:40,019
When I joined a start-up, I knew that 19 out of 20 fail.

875
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:41,088
When an employee comes

876
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:43,034
to work at Netscape today,

877
00:39:43,034 --> 00:39:44,088
he doesn't have the perception

878
00:39:44,088 --> 00:39:46,046
that there's a 19 out of 20 chance

879
00:39:46,046 --> 00:39:48,051
that this job is not gonna be in place

880
00:39:48,051 --> 00:39:49,098
1 to 5 years from now.

881
00:39:52,075 --> 00:39:56,046
If you live here, it is the ubiquitous conversation

882
00:39:56,046 --> 00:39:58,030
"Do you believe that Microsoft

883
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,021
has used either a) illegal

884
00:40:00,026 --> 00:40:02,038
or just unfair methods

885
00:40:02,038 --> 00:40:04,063
to take market share from Netscape?"

886
00:40:04,063 --> 00:40:07,086
And if the heart and soul of this industry is

887
00:40:07,086 --> 00:40:12,007
opportunity, is egalitarianism, Microsoft having

888
00:40:12,007 --> 00:40:15,013
achieved its market share

889
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:18,082
on anything other than the backs of its code

890
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:22,017
really riles every body up.

891
00:40:22,026 --> 00:40:25,026
Justice department has charged Microsoft

892
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:29,065
with engaging an anti-competitive and exclusionary practises

893
00:40:29,065 --> 00:40:34,046
designed to maintain its monopoly in personal computer operating systems

894
00:40:34,082 --> 00:40:39,046
and attempting to extend that monopoly to Internet browser software.

895
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:41,082
Regardless of its case against Microsoft,

896
00:40:41,086 --> 00:40:44,065
Netscape has become a victim of its increasing size

897
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:46,057
and the growing complexities of its code,

898
00:40:46,067 --> 00:40:49,015
the company struggles to maintain the vitality

899
00:40:49,017 --> 00:40:51,015
it enjoyed as a start-up.

900
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:53,065
When a company gets to be above a certain size,

901
00:40:53,065 --> 00:40:57,036
it's just a process, it's a mechanism for making money.

902
00:40:57,046 --> 00:41:00,013
And innovation is like one possible way of doing that,

903
00:41:00,015 --> 00:41:00,098
but it's a risky way.

904
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:02,067
So companies, big companies don't do that.

905
00:41:02,076 --> 00:41:06,057
Um, Microsoft actually doesn't do very much, they buy companies.

906
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:08,096
They wait until someone has done something interesting and then they acquire them,

907
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:10,040
and then they milk it for all it's worth.

908
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:15,007
I don't mean to pick on Microsoft because lots of companies do that, it's just the normal way of doing business.

909
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:26,030
We're on out way to the Flint Center now.

910
00:41:26,078 --> 00:41:28,023
We're going to have an all-hands meeting.

911
00:41:28,026 --> 00:41:32,030
Jim Barksdale has moved up the all hands meeting by roughly about a week.

912
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:36,001
We just announce quarterly results and now this major change in direction.

913
00:41:38,084 --> 00:41:43,000
Well, in case you haven't read the newspaper,

914
00:41:45,067 --> 00:41:50,098
we have, as of 1:30 this morning,

915
00:41:52,098 --> 00:42:02,028
concluded negotiations and agreed to sell our company to AOL of Dulles, Virginia.

916
00:42:06,086 --> 00:42:10,026
I can't imagine that day when they announced the merger,

917
00:42:10,036 --> 00:42:13,036
that they weren't like "Oh, I don't believe this".

918
00:42:13,046 --> 00:42:16,030
You know, sort of a nightmare scenario.

919
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,076
Although, you know, the worst one would have been

920
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,076
Microsoft's buying us, I guess, you know.

921
00:42:19,076 --> 00:42:21,088
Then they would have, you know you would've seen like

922
00:42:21,096 --> 00:42:24,023
his this flow of cars out of Netscape

923
00:42:24,023 --> 00:42:27,038
Six months ago they were insulting AOL's technology,

924
00:42:27,038 --> 00:42:30,009
you know, it was the service for idiots.

925
00:42:30,009 --> 00:42:31,096
"Congratulations skippy, you've got mail!"

926
00:42:32,036 --> 00:42:37,076
Netscape is not unusual in the way they felt about AOL in Silicon Valley.

927
00:42:37,076 --> 00:42:39,096
I mean, it's very clear that nobody

928
00:42:39,096 --> 00:42:41,046
had any respect for the company.

929
00:42:41,046 --> 00:42:42,094
One of them at Netscape

930
00:42:42,094 --> 00:42:45,005
called Steve Case a soap salesman

931
00:42:45,005 --> 00:42:47,005
because he used to work at Proctor and Gamble.

932
00:42:48,007 --> 00:42:49,032
The soap salesman bought them.

933
00:42:50,076 --> 00:42:54,017
The quote that came out of this article was

934
00:42:54,017 --> 00:42:57,059
"Netscape: (similar lines of) lived fast,

935
00:42:57,059 --> 00:42:59,057
died young, and left a tired corpse".

936
00:42:59,067 --> 00:43:03,046
And I don't know they agree with that.

937
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,086
I don't think Netscape's done yet.

938
00:43:05,086 --> 00:43:07,011
They bought us because they like us,

939
00:43:07,011 --> 00:43:07,098
they like what we do,

940
00:43:08,026 --> 00:43:10,063
and they don't want to disturb that formula;

941
00:43:11,023 --> 00:43:13,086
so their plan is to not damage us in any way.

942
00:43:14,032 --> 00:43:16,015
There had been alot of, uh,

943
00:43:16,023 --> 00:43:17,094
a lot of speculation out on the net,

944
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,038
you know, in the free software community, like

945
00:43:19,038 --> 00:43:20,082
oh well this is it, you know,

946
00:43:20,082 --> 00:43:21,067
it's all over now

947
00:43:21,067 --> 00:43:23,038
"AOL's just gonna screw everything up".

948
00:43:23,038 --> 00:43:24,015
So I wrote this thing

949
00:43:24,015 --> 00:43:25,073
that I put on the Mozilla.org site

950
00:43:25,073 --> 00:43:27,080
that just laid out the worst case scenario,

951
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,076
like, well okay,

952
00:43:29,026 --> 00:43:31,046
even if everything goes wrong

953
00:43:31,055 --> 00:43:33,061
it's still not as bad as you're saying it is.

954
00:43:33,084 --> 00:43:36,036
Because the nature of what Netscape did

955
00:43:36,036 --> 00:43:39,098
meant that the code belongs to the community now.

956
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,065
Few days later I got email from Steve Case,

957
00:43:42,065 --> 00:43:44,057
saying, um, we think that you're doing is great thing

958
00:43:44,057 --> 00:43:45,069
and it's part of the reason we bought the company

959
00:43:45,069 --> 00:43:47,038
we plan to keep it going that way, so

960
00:43:47,084 --> 00:43:52,019
um, as far as Mozilla.org and Netscape and AOL's contribution

961
00:43:52,034 --> 00:43:55,075
to the open-source movement goes,

962
00:43:55,075 --> 00:43:57,026
he says, it's gonna continue...

963
00:43:58,032 --> 00:44:01,071
The merger with AOL creates a windfall for shareholders

964
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:05,055
that will give Netscape employees the chance to cash out and move on,

965
00:44:05,065 --> 00:44:07,092
causing speculation in the national media

966
00:44:07,092 --> 00:44:11,076
about AOL's ability to retain Netscape's key people.

967
00:44:12,065 --> 00:44:14,026
And already I hear, you know,

968
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,023
that AOL people come at Netscape and say,

969
00:44:16,023 --> 00:44:17,057
yeah this is the AOL way.

970
00:44:17,057 --> 00:44:19,067
It's not gonna work at Netscape.

971
00:44:19,067 --> 00:44:22,090
It's gonna be the Netscape way with help from AOL!

972
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:24,065
I suspect some of them will leave.

973
00:44:24,065 --> 00:44:26,080
You know, they don't want to be part of AOL.

974
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:29,011
Some people just like the start-up mentality.

975
00:44:29,026 --> 00:44:32,000
And those that want to be part of a juggernaut

976
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,092
are going to stay and be part of the juggernaut.

977
00:44:34,028 --> 00:44:38,001
I've been at Netscape for 3 and a half years and it feels like forever.

978
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:44,019
And AOL's focus and Netscape's growing focus has been marketing and advertising,

979
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:45,023
all that stuff, and that's

980
00:44:45,096 --> 00:44:48,053
not nearly as interesting

981
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:50,080
to someone who's sort of a techno-fetishist.

982
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:53,028
I'm switching jobs and selling my house,

983
00:44:53,028 --> 00:44:55,000
I'm moving, switching towns...

984
00:44:56,067 --> 00:45:00,009
That's life for start-up land.

985
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:03,015
I'm still young and stupid as I like to put it,

986
00:45:03,015 --> 00:45:05,005
so I can get away with that stuff like that.

987
00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:10,011
Year and a half ago, so Tara comes to me she says

988
00:45:10,011 --> 00:45:13,057
"I want to be a manager so bad, that I can taste it".

989
00:45:13,057 --> 00:45:17,055
So we finally said alright, you get to be a manager.

990
00:45:17,055 --> 00:45:20,055
And like within a week she said

991
00:45:20,055 --> 00:45:22,075
"Why did you ever let me do this?"

992
00:45:25,075 --> 00:45:30,009
And Tara has turned out to be like one of Netscape's greatest managers.

993
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:34,019
So here is to Tara, release team manager.

994
00:45:34,071 --> 00:45:37,055
Tara leaves Netscape for an e-commerce start-up,

995
00:45:37,055 --> 00:45:40,063
missing out on a big jump in the value of her stock options

996
00:45:40,063 --> 00:45:42,094
in hopes for a bigger pay out at her new company.

997
00:45:52,076 --> 00:45:57,069
Regardless of how AOL runs the Netscape business,

998
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,098
it's not Netscape anymore - that part's over.

999
00:45:59,098 --> 00:46:01,080
And you know, that's really sad

1000
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,023
I wish Netscape could have gone it on their own.

1001
00:46:04,026 --> 00:46:08,050
Frustrated by what he perceives as a lack of commitment to open-source development,

1002
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:12,059
Jamie quits Netscape one year to the day he helped to give away Mozilla.

1003
00:46:13,034 --> 00:46:16,019
The movie Hackers I think is just a great movie.

1004
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:18,000
I wish our lives were like that,

1005
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,015
I wish we were roller skating around in spandex and fighting bad guys,

1006
00:46:21,015 --> 00:46:25,065
but you know it's not it's sitting in a room and typing all day.

1007
00:46:28,015 --> 00:46:31,073
This is what I was trying to escape, this life.

1008
00:46:31,073 --> 00:46:33,094
I knew I did not want to live here.

1009
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:38,075
I've been out here now about four of five years.

1010
00:46:38,075 --> 00:46:43,050
This is a nice place. This is escape from the jungle.

1011
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:53,007
Jim Roskind is promoted to Netscape's highest engineering rank.

1012
00:46:53,098 --> 00:46:55,094
Last night I was here at four in the morning,

1013
00:46:55,098 --> 00:46:59,019
and this isn't even in the middle of a critical push.

1014
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:01,084
But it's almost like an addiction, an adrenaline rush,

1015
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:03,090
a going for perfection, a pushing.

1016
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:08,048
And then as you see the results, you get the feedback to push harder.

1017
00:47:12,096 --> 00:47:14,098
You know I really shouldn't comment on this

1018
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:16,038
since I'm just as foolish as everyone else is

1019
00:47:16,038 --> 00:47:18,007
but I'll just go ahead and do it while admitting that I'm foolish,

1020
00:47:18,007 --> 00:47:20,090
there's just a tremendous quest for material wealth here.

1021
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,019
It's like the goldrush all over again.

1022
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:26,040
And this is gonna be the playhouse.

1023
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:29,021
And then this will be like a front porch I think a little flowers and stuff.

1024
00:47:29,021 --> 00:47:30,067
So it will be like a cute little house.

1025
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:34,080
I went to Netscape because its main purpose was to generate cash,

1026
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,050
based on this Internet thing.

1027
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:38,057
It's like what we're gonna do, we're gonna get rich.

1028
00:47:38,057 --> 00:47:41,088
It just took a heavy toll on our marriage,

1029
00:47:41,088 --> 00:47:44,050
and, if it wasn't for God's grace,

1030
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:46,003
we wouldn't have made it.

1031
00:47:46,009 --> 00:47:49,044
"Why would I use god gives"

1032
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,080
Micheal burned out.

1033
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:57,003
Micheal, came to a place, in his own life where he said the cost is too great,

1034
00:47:57,003 --> 00:47:59,019
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

1035
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:02,048
If people are - would look at this and say oh

1036
00:48:02,048 --> 00:48:04,098
hey this is a cool thing, I'm gonna start a start-up

1037
00:48:04,098 --> 00:48:06,075
and get rich quick

1038
00:48:06,075 --> 00:48:08,036
I would just have to say

1039
00:48:08,036 --> 00:48:09,073
you need to count the costs

1040
00:48:10,009 --> 00:48:13,036
because you can't ever retrieve the time that's lost.

1041
00:48:13,096 --> 00:48:15,026
Michael Toy

1042
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:17,009
Netscape employee number 6

1043
00:48:17,009 --> 00:48:19,030
achieved his goal of financial independance

1044
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,094
and retired from Netscape shortly after Mozilla's release.

1045
00:48:29,011 --> 00:48:30,032
In the Valley,

1046
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:33,069
if you've stayed someplace longer than about three years

1047
00:48:33,069 --> 00:48:35,021
people wonder what's going on?

1048
00:48:35,021 --> 00:48:37,021
Why can't you get another job, what's wrong with you?

1049
00:48:37,021 --> 00:48:39,021
If you're a programmer, you pretty much change jobs

1050
00:48:39,021 --> 00:48:41,021
about every two years or so.

1051
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:43,021
It's like ants,

1052
00:48:43,021 --> 00:48:43,088
worker ants.

1053
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:45,088
They send out a group out to do something.

1054
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,065
As that group approaches

1055
00:48:47,065 --> 00:48:48,096
the task that they're gonna do

1056
00:48:48,096 --> 00:48:50,096
some ants leave, more ants come on

1057
00:48:50,096 --> 00:48:53,001
By the time it gets to the target

1058
00:48:53,001 --> 00:48:54,050
it could be a totally different set of ants

1059
00:48:54,071 --> 00:48:58,051
I think as we distribute the set of work that we're doing

1060
00:48:58,051 --> 00:49:00,051
and more and more, in the Information Age

1061
00:49:01,048 --> 00:49:02,061
it'll be more like that.

1062
00:49:03,034 --> 00:49:07,011
Scott Collins continues to commute to Netscape from Michigan.

1063
00:49:11,044 --> 00:49:12,082
There's lot of pressure right now

1064
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:14,082
to complete our product on time.

1065
00:49:15,026 --> 00:49:17,048
Um, sort of wade in with

1066
00:49:17,071 --> 00:49:21,042
the ridiculous acrobatics the stock is doing.

1067
00:49:21,075 --> 00:49:23,042
We were a 20$ company

1068
00:49:23,042 --> 00:49:26,082
and as of this moment our stock is at 172$.

1069
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,088
So it's hard to be depressed about the amount of work

1070
00:49:29,088 --> 00:49:31,055
you have to do when

1071
00:49:31,055 --> 00:49:33,055
every other cube holds a millionnaire.

1072
00:49:35,046 --> 00:49:38,090
When the deal with AOL closes in the Spring of 1999

1073
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:43,013
the value of Netscape's stock more than doubled since the merger's announcement.

1074
00:49:44,028 --> 00:49:45,082
Netscape married right.

1075
00:49:46,032 --> 00:49:49,026
They hitched their fortunes to AOL

1076
00:49:49,026 --> 00:49:51,026
when the transaction was announced,

1077
00:49:51,038 --> 00:49:54,084
the implied valuation was about 4.2 billion

1078
00:49:54,098 --> 00:49:56,084
when transaction was completed,

1079
00:49:57,023 --> 00:50:00,017
the transaction was valued at 10 billion.

1080
00:50:00,017 --> 00:50:04,034
So in effect about 5.5 or 6 billion dollars

1081
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:06,063
of net worth was created

1082
00:50:06,063 --> 00:50:10,046
so I think it was the very clever deal-making

1083
00:50:10,046 --> 00:50:13,088
of Netscape management that kept them in the game

1084
00:50:13,088 --> 00:50:18,055
much longer and Netscape's shareholders benefited quite considerably.

1085
00:50:19,051 --> 00:50:20,073
Mo-

1086
00:50:20,078 --> 00:50:21,086
-zill-

1087
00:50:21,086 --> 00:50:22,094
-la

1088
00:50:22,094 --> 00:50:24,028
lives!

1089
00:50:24,028 --> 00:50:26,044
While many executives sold their stock

1090
00:50:26,044 --> 00:50:28,003
during Netscape's final year

1091
00:50:28,003 --> 00:50:29,061
Barksdale bought more

1092
00:50:29,061 --> 00:50:31,088
and after the merger he swapped his shares

1093
00:50:31,088 --> 00:50:35,000
for more than half a billion dollars of AOL stock.

1094
00:50:39,009 --> 00:50:40,090
Another young man comes west

1095
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:44,021
to seek his fortune on technology's new frontier.

1096
00:50:44,021 --> 00:50:46,090
I'm a little bit nervous going into this interview,

1097
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:50,030
cause I'm not entirely sure what to expect.

1098
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:52,017
It's a long way away

1099
00:50:52,017 --> 00:50:54,005
Three thousand miles

1100
00:50:54,005 --> 00:50:57,026
is a long way for your child to be

1101
00:50:57,026 --> 00:51:02,036
But this is a place where there's a lot going on that

1102
00:51:02,036 --> 00:51:04,040
he's very interested in and I think

1103
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,040
has some talents in this area.

1104
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,046
And I really think that this may be

1105
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:13,017
kind of home for him as far as

1106
00:51:13,017 --> 00:51:15,017
being able to work with people

1107
00:51:15,017 --> 00:51:17,051
that he can actually talk to.

1108
00:51:23,026 --> 00:51:24,094
- Pavlov!

1109
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:29,038
- What I want to know is,

1110
00:51:29,051 --> 00:51:30,086
what you want to do

1111
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:33,063
I mean, what your goals are in the next couple of years?

1112
00:51:33,063 --> 00:51:35,003
- My goal right now

1113
00:51:35,003 --> 00:51:38,069
is that I want to see the UNIX version faster than the Windows version.

1114
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:41,007
Once you pull that off,

1115
00:51:41,007 --> 00:51:43,026
then, you know, we'll see.

1116
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,028
But that's my goal.

1117
00:51:45,073 --> 00:51:47,086
Pavlov is hired by Netscape.

1118
00:51:47,086 --> 00:51:50,015
He postpones going to college.

1119
00:51:52,036 --> 00:51:55,005
Taking part in what one investor has called the largest

1120
00:51:55,005 --> 00:51:57,073
legal creation of wealth in the history of the planet,

1121
00:51:57,073 --> 00:52:00,059
David Readerman moves to a new investment bank.

1122
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,057
Here's the data center,

1123
00:52:05,057 --> 00:52:08,017
a lot of cable, a lot of fiber.

1124
00:52:08,034 --> 00:52:12,026
These can be sort of, you know, Internet connections

1125
00:52:12,032 --> 00:52:14,078
they can be our trading lines, our phone lines.

1126
00:52:14,078 --> 00:52:17,078
You know we're lying the infrastructure

1127
00:52:17,078 --> 00:52:21,003
to basically build a major merchant bank.

1128
00:52:21,057 --> 00:52:24,051
Our view is that the Internet changes everything

1129
00:52:24,051 --> 00:52:26,084
and we're going to finance the companies

1130
00:52:26,084 --> 00:52:29,032
that want to be the agents of that change.

1131
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,003
Look at this intersection,

1132
00:52:38,003 --> 00:52:40,032
we've got a bank here,

1133
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:42,098
in two years you know this may not be here,

1134
00:52:42,098 --> 00:52:45,032
why not bank online?

1135
00:52:47,051 --> 00:52:49,015
Gap's website

1136
00:52:49,015 --> 00:52:52,059
is one of the most successful commerce websites

1137
00:52:52,059 --> 00:52:54,059
on the market.

1138
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:59,003
I don't even know why Gap's renovating this store?

1139
00:52:59,003 --> 00:53:01,059
Why aren't they investing more in their website?

1140
00:53:03,036 --> 00:53:06,048
I don't know what this intersection may look two years from now.

1141
00:53:09,023 --> 00:53:11,017
When I started people didn't know what HTML was,

1142
00:53:11,017 --> 00:53:12,088
what the World Wide Web was, and then all of a sudden

1143
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:14,088
the power of the Internet that had been there

1144
00:53:14,088 --> 00:53:17,013
for years was available to everybody

1145
00:53:17,025 --> 00:53:20,032
in an easy way, Point & click, the universal language.

1146
00:53:20,032 --> 00:53:23,076
It's like in Fantasia when Mickey is standing over

1147
00:53:23,084 --> 00:53:25,040
the book that's open on the mountain,

1148
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,051
and he's looking in to see what to do

1149
00:53:26,051 --> 00:53:28,051
and he does something. And he doesn't really know what he does

1150
00:53:28,075 --> 00:53:29,088
but it makes something happen.

1151
00:53:29,088 --> 00:53:32,026
And of course this thing gets out of control and keeps going.

1152
00:53:32,028 --> 00:53:33,098
You don't know why it works, you don't know how it works,

1153
00:53:33,098 --> 00:53:35,078
you just push a button and it works.

1154
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:37,080
We're at the beginning of an industry and

1155
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,080
who knows where that industry's gonna go?

1156
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,088
This could all turn into television again.

1157
00:53:41,088 --> 00:53:44,057
It could be controlled by a small number of

1158
00:53:45,086 --> 00:53:48,017
companies who decide what we see and hear.

1159
00:53:48,017 --> 00:53:50,017
And there's a lot of precedent for that.

1160
00:53:51,034 --> 00:53:53,051
I'm just laying down the tracks

1161
00:53:53,051 --> 00:53:55,051
and there were these trains zooming by me,

1162
00:53:55,051 --> 00:53:57,044
and there's no way I'd want to say it's a

1163
00:53:57,044 --> 00:53:59,044
bad thing to have these trains fly by.

1164
00:54:00,038 --> 00:54:01,086
I could be a horrible legacy.

1165
00:54:01,086 --> 00:54:04,023
If it ended up being a legacy of,

1166
00:54:04,023 --> 00:54:06,059
you know, Netscape and the Internet,

1167
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:09,007
that we could all like,

1168
00:54:10,019 --> 00:54:11,067
do what we're doing only under

1169
00:54:11,067 --> 00:54:13,036
much more intense pressure and

1170
00:54:13,067 --> 00:54:14,071
much faster.

1171
00:54:17,009 --> 00:54:18,044
Everything has to change faster,

1172
00:54:18,044 --> 00:54:20,015
obviously, you know, look at Netscape.

1173
00:54:20,015 --> 00:54:22,015
It was born and died.

1174
00:54:22,015 --> 00:54:23,094
I don't want to use the word "died", they wouldn't like that word.

1175
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:26,030
But basically it was born and overtaken

1176
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,076
within four years.

1177
00:54:27,076 --> 00:54:30,005
That's pretty fast, I think.

1178
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,082
They must think it's very fast.

1179
00:54:31,082 --> 00:54:33,082
Near the end of 1999,

1180
00:54:33,082 --> 00:54:35,051
the public still awaits Netscape's

1181
00:54:35,051 --> 00:54:37,051
first open source browser,

1182
00:54:37,051 --> 00:54:39,098
more than a year after Mozilla was released.

1183
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:42,011
The judge and the justice department

1184
00:54:42,011 --> 00:54:44,044
end a trust trial rules that Microsoft

1185
00:54:44,046 --> 00:54:46,076
is a monopoly, it stiffles innovation.

1186
00:54:46,076 --> 00:54:48,057
AOL begins the millenium

1187
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:50,061
with a new even larger aquisition,

1188
00:54:50,061 --> 00:54:53,042
and investors continue buying technology stocks,

1189
00:54:53,042 --> 00:54:56,021
which trade with increasing volatility.

1190
00:54:56,086 --> 00:54:59,028
Still as the Internet finds its way

1191
00:54:59,028 --> 00:55:01,005
into every corner of daily life,

1192
00:55:01,005 --> 00:55:03,017
so, too will legions of programmers

1193
00:55:03,017 --> 00:55:05,038
and their code, working fast

1194
00:55:05,038 --> 00:55:07,038
and late into the night.
