            <p begin="00:00:00.390" end="00:00:02.567">Tangible problems.</p>
            <p begin="00:00:02.567" end="00:00:05.719">I always felt from as long as I can <br/>remember about the power of science,</p>
            <p begin="00:00:05.719" end="00:00:09.242">that it could be used to solve pressing issues, <br/>solve problems.</p>
            <p begin="00:00:09.242" end="00:00:12.837">When I studied Chemistry at Princeton it was so theoretical, unapplied.</p>
            <p begin="00:00:12.837" end="00:00:16.055">And I thought oh ok, maybe if I go into physics it will get better. </p>
            <p begin="00:00:16.055" end="00:00:18.882">So I did, and was grossly disappointed.</p>
            <p begin="00:00:18.882" end="00:00:24.222">We were studying wave propagation, and I couldn't<br/>understand this one problem, this one equation.</p>
            <p begin="00:00:24.222" end="00:00:28.613">So I went to the professor and I said whats this about,<br/>where does this exist?</p>
            <p begin="00:00:28.613" end="00:00:31.733">And he said well it actually doesn't exist, I just made it up.</p>
            <p begin="00:00:31.733" end="00:00:34.996">It's like, oh ok, so that's what we do here. </p>
            <p begin="00:00:34.996" end="00:00:38.981">That was one of those turning points where I said,<br/>wow what am I doing here?</p>
            <p begin="00:00:38.981" end="00:00:43.484">In an absolute abundance of resources, power,</p>
            <p begin="00:00:43.484" end="00:00:46.132">human development and culture and everything,</p>
            <p begin="00:00:46.132" end="00:00:51.497">still there's many issues. Mainly the resource conflicts.<br/>Poverty, war, depravation.</p>
            <p begin="00:00:52.419" end="00:00:56.212">Survival with the awesome technology that we do have today? </p>
            <p begin="00:00:56.212" end="00:00:59.011">Survival should not take a lot of time.</p>
            <p begin="00:00:59.887" end="00:01:04.722">When you really think about it, all the wealth that we enjoy today for a modern standard of living </p>
            <p begin="00:01:04.722" end="00:01:10.307">relies on rocks, soil, sunlight, plants, water.</p>
            <p begin="00:01:10.307" end="00:01:11.935">Those are all abundant.</p>
            <p begin="00:01:11.935" end="00:01:17.136"> Yet the productive mechanism of society is what makes it scarce, artificially so.</p>
            <p begin="00:01:17.136" end="00:01:23.304">What if we could survive and thrive up to a modern standard of living,</p>
            <p begin="00:01:23.304" end="00:01:28.286">and not only that, at two hours a day of work, and from local resources. </p>
            <p begin="00:01:28.286" end="00:01:29.942">How would that be?</p>
            <p begin="00:01:29.942" end="00:01:33.296">The most important part of Open Source Ecology is this idea that</p>
            <p begin="00:01:33.296" end="00:01:36.793">with a small amount of resources and a small amount of money,</p>
            <p begin="00:01:36.793" end="00:01:42.193">anybody should be able to create a high standard of living for themselves,</p>
            <p begin="00:01:42.193" end="00:01:46.211">and do it in a way that doesn't require a whole lot of time, a whole lot of money.</p>
            <p begin="00:01:46.211" end="00:01:50.116">People can actually be empowered by the technology we're creating here, </p>
            <p begin="00:01:50.116" end="00:01:54.487">so rather than a big corporation deciding what machines can do for us, </p>
            <p begin="00:01:54.487" end="00:01:58.269">we can decide how we want machines to work for us.</p>
            <p begin="00:01:58.269" end="00:02:01.981">Instead of relying on other people to make things that we need, </p>
            <p begin="00:02:01.981" end="00:02:04.546">we can make everything that we need for ourselves.</p>
            <p begin="00:02:04.546" end="00:02:07.220">And we can do it better than Walmart can do it, </p>
            <p begin="00:02:07.220" end="00:02:10.972">we can do it better than slave labour in China can do it.</p>
            <p begin="00:02:10.972" end="00:02:15.318">We can make the productive capacity that we need to live the lives that we want </p>
            <p begin="00:02:15.318" end="00:02:19.103">in our own back yards, and we can do it in a sustainable way. </p>
            <p begin="00:02:19.103" end="00:02:22.974">We can make machines that we can use to create material abundance for ourselves, </p>
            <p begin="00:02:22.974" end="00:02:26.121">and then we can show other people how to do it.</p>
            <p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:29.195">If you have two-hundred people get together </p>
            <p begin="00:02:29.195" end="00:02:32.184">and if they want to put together a self-sustaining community, </p>
            <p begin="00:02:32.184" end="00:02:38.116">they don't have many options as far as coming up with the equipment and machines for doing that. </p>
            <p begin="00:02:38.116" end="00:02:41.768">That's where Open Source Ecology really comes in.</p>
            <p begin="00:02:41.768" end="00:02:47.861">The costs of building these machines is about ten percent of what you would buy it for commercially. </p>
            <p begin="00:02:47.861" end="00:02:51.163">If you take a full blown John Deere tractor, </p>
            <p begin="00:02:51.163" end="00:02:55.313">it's almost impossible for anyone to go out and try to build one of those for themselves.</p>
            <p begin="00:02:55.313" end="00:02:57.712">I mean that's just a very custom machine. </p>
            <p begin="00:02:57.712" end="00:03:02.387">But if you're able to take off-the-shelf engines and </p>
            <p begin="00:03:02.387" end="00:03:07.252">go down to your hardware store and buy steel and build it yourself, like the Lifetrac, </p>
            <p begin="00:03:07.252" end="00:03:10.057">then that's much more realistic. </p>
            <p begin="00:03:10.057" end="00:03:11.929">The benefits of a localized economy are that</p>
            <p begin="00:03:11.929" end="00:03:14.361">the power stays within the community, the economic wealth.</p>
            <p begin="00:03:14.361" end="00:03:18.778">Instead of your money, the earnings, going all the way down the river, </p>
            <p begin="00:03:18.778" end="00:03:20.834">what if we can internalise that? </p>
            <p begin="00:03:20.834" end="00:03:22.015">Keep that wealth in,</p>
            <p begin="00:03:22.015" end="00:03:24.859">by having all that productive mechanism built in.</p>
            <p begin="00:03:24.859" end="00:03:28.508">You produce the same, the wealth stays in, you don't have to work so hard. </p>
            <p begin="00:03:28.508" end="00:03:33.231">Then you can have time for you family and kids, or whatever else is more important to you. </p>
            <p begin="00:03:35.167" end="00:03:43.220">So it's a lot easier productionwise to just have one super compatible module.</p>
            <p begin="00:03:43.220" end="00:03:47.616">The Powercube right now works with both the Lifetrac and the CEB Press,</p>
            <p begin="00:03:47.616" end="00:03:51.576">and a few other machines we have, like the Ironworker and the Coldsaw.</p>
            <p begin="00:03:51.576" end="00:03:57.612">So that provides a much simpler product ecology </p>
            <p begin="00:03:57.612" end="00:04:01.851">because one power unit serves multiple machines. </p>
            <p begin="00:04:01.851" end="00:04:07.514">There is one thing about just being able to look at machines that have been developed on site here,</p>
            <p begin="00:04:07.514" end="00:04:12.713">and another thing to understand how the development process went through and</p>
            <p begin="00:04:12.713" end="00:04:15.777">what kind of documentation there is for these machines,</p>
            <p begin="00:04:15.777" end="00:04:19.109">such that can be replicated and improved on.</p>
            <p begin="00:04:19.109" end="00:04:25.593">Fortunately we have that ability to have machine information in the digital format,</p>
            <p begin="00:04:25.593" end="00:04:29.982">and now we have telecom, the Internet, to relay that information and </p>
            <p begin="00:04:29.982" end="00:04:33.056">have anyone just copy over the files,</p>
            <p begin="00:04:33.056" end="00:04:36.782">and have access to the model on their computer.</p>
            <p begin="00:04:36.782" end="00:04:39.947">So Open Source Ecology tries to capture the open source nature of development and the fact</p>
            <p begin="00:04:39.947" end="00:04:45.091">that we're connected to Nature, to other people, to societal institutions.</p>
            <p begin="00:04:45.091" end="00:04:49.298">That all has to be considered if we're talking about a paradigm to make a better world.</p>
            <p begin="00:04:49.298" end="00:04:56.262">Open source was clearly the emerging trend that was so powerful.</p>
            <p begin="00:04:56.262" end="00:05:00.170">Demonstrated with open source software like the Linux platform. </p>
            <p begin="00:05:00.170" end="00:05:02.809">When a sufficient number of people come together on a project, </p>
            <p begin="00:05:02.809" end="00:05:05.303">that project simply becomes better than anything else.</p>
            <p begin="00:05:05.303" end="00:05:08.821">So we're transitioning that into the hardware space.</p>
            <p begin="00:05:08.821" end="00:05:13.063">What would happen if people actually collaborated on making open source hardware?</p>
            <p begin="00:05:13.063" end="00:05:15.514">We have lots of technology out there.</p>
            <p begin="00:05:15.514" end="00:05:19.331">But to organise the technology in such a way that it's accessible, </p>
            <p begin="00:05:19.331" end="00:05:23.736">without barriers to people, that is a very significant move forward. </p>
            <p begin="00:05:23.736" end="00:05:28.636">Now it's there for the individuals to organise themselves, </p>
            <p begin="00:05:28.636" end="00:05:34.523">and to really dig deeply, almost to what you would say a spiritual level.</p>
            <p begin="00:05:34.523" end="00:05:39.331">To really change their attitudes, and to take advantage of what is there, </p>
            <p begin="00:05:39.331" end="00:05:43.116">and to move our civilisation forward. </p>
            <p begin="00:05:43.116" end="00:05:47.002">I'm hopeful that human kind will arise to the occasion and</p>
            <p begin="00:05:47.002" end="00:05:51.119">seize the opportunity offered by this development.</p>
            <p begin="00:05:51.119" end="00:05:56.607">Open Source Ecology is really about creating the next economy: the open source economy.</p>
            <p begin="00:05:56.607" end="00:06:01.674">And what does that mean? It's an economy that optimises not only production,</p>
            <p begin="00:06:01.674" end="00:06:04.312"> which the present economy is really good at, </p>
            <p begin="00:06:04.312" end="00:06:07.609">it's effective in production, but distribution is not so great. </p>
            <p begin="00:06:07.609" end="00:06:10.939">And how do you do that? And that is by opening...</p>
            <p begin="00:06:10.939" end="00:06:15.031">so called giving away trade secrets for free, or</p>
            <p begin="00:06:15.031" end="00:06:19.183">developing open source products for just about anything that we use. </p>
            <p begin="00:06:19.183" end="00:06:24.680">So imagine a scenario where instead of corporations all competing, reinventing the wheel and so forth,</p>
            <p begin="00:06:24.680" end="00:06:29.768">a lot of competitive waste, what if everyone were to join together to make the best products,</p>
            <p begin="00:06:29.768" end="00:06:33.421">the most robust products, that are open source, that anyone has access to producing them.</p>
            <p begin="00:06:33.421" end="00:06:35.822">And therefore we can run an economy in a collaborative way,</p>
            <p begin="00:06:35.822" end="00:06:39.109">as opposed to a competitive wasteful way.</p>
