00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:02,093
We started <b>Universal Subtitles</b> because we believe

2
00:00:02,093 --> 00:00:06,063
every video on the web should be subtitle-able.

3
00:00:06,063 --> 00:00:11,050
Millions of Deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers require subtitles to access video.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,025
Videomakers and websites should <i>really</i> care about this stuff too.

5
00:00:15,025 --> 00:00:20,076
Subtitles give them access to a <u>wider audience</u> and they also get better search rankings.

6
00:00:20,076 --> 00:00:27,026
Universal Subtitles makes it incredibly easy to add subtitles to almost any video.

7
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:32,033
Take an existing video on the web, submit the <b>URL<br/></b> to our website

8
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:39,003
and then type along with the dialog
to create the subtitles

9
00:00:39,003 --> 00:00:44,049
After that, tap on your keyboard to sync them with the video.

10
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:47,041
Then you're doneâ€” we give you an embed code for the video
