0:00:17.015,0:00:20.023
I talk to lots of people who come here

0:00:20.023,0:00:22.005
looking for the Silicon Valley experience

0:00:22.008,0:00:24.041
They arrive with one suit case in hand

0:00:24.041,0:00:28.002
when they head south on the 101.

0:00:28.005,0:00:29.023
Hoping to see it this place they've heard about

0:00:29.033,0:00:34.073
and its freeways, and its office parks

0:00:34.073,0:00:37.046
and its strip malls, and

0:00:37.046,0:00:39.022
it looks like every place they've ever been

0:00:39.023,0:00:41.089
end up wondering where are they come,

0:00:41.089,0:00:42.049
why did they come here,

0:00:42.051,0:00:44.053
what was that brought them

0:00:46.092,0:00:51.053
Code itself is the underlying thing that makes computers work

0:00:51.053,0:00:54.010
Why is it important to the world, it's because

0:00:54.010,0:00:58.020
it's the blood of the organism, that's our culture now,

0:00:58.020,0:01:00.020
it makes everything go

0:01:01.057,0:01:04.068
Technology has become a God of our society now

0:01:04.068,0:01:06.068
I mean I think that its--people stand in awe of it

0:01:06.068,0:01:09.037
and stand in awe of the people that make it

0:01:18.085,0:01:22.062
There's a sense that software is a kind of new frontier

0:01:22.062,0:01:24.068
it's you know it's the old gold rush metaphor

0:01:24.068,0:01:26.068
the California gold rush all over again

0:01:26.073,0:01:30.003
It's the kind of Hollywood of the Twenties.

0:01:30.003,0:01:34.067
This very small set of people is really defining

0:01:34.067,0:01:36.082
how our world's gonna be like

0:01:36.093,0:01:40.034
I mean you know the computer becoming ubiquitous

0:01:40.034,0:01:42.048
and the way we interact with the world

0:01:42.048,0:01:45.029
more and more mediated through the computer

0:01:45.065,0:01:47.098
is this very small group of people

0:01:47.098,0:01:50.098
defining what that world's gonna be like.

0:01:52.029,0:01:53.048
Netscape!

0:01:53.048,0:01:54.076
everywhere!

0:01:54.076,0:01:55.073
team!

0:01:55.073,0:01:56.054
fight!

0:01:57.079,0:01:59.048
Less than three years ago

0:01:59.048,0:02:02.043
a small team of engineers at Netscape Communications

0:02:02.043,0:02:05.042
created software that made surfing the Internet easy

0:02:05.042,0:02:08.056
and in the process change the face of computing

0:02:09.068,0:02:12.099
On this day however, the company is in big trouble

0:02:12.099,0:02:17.037
driven to the ground by its rival and software colossus Microsoft

0:02:17.037,0:02:20.040
Only a radical strategy will help save it.

0:02:20.084,0:02:22.088
"Let's hear a loud Mozilla!"

0:02:22.088,0:02:28.008
Mozilla! Mozilla! Mozilla!

0:02:28.072,0:02:30.078
Netscape is giving away its source code

0:02:30.078,0:02:33.009
to programmers outside the company

0:02:33.077,0:02:37.024
The source code is the secret formula for browsing the web

0:02:38.003,0:02:41.024
The code is named Mozilla and if widely adapted

0:02:41.024,0:02:44.003
it will make Netscape's code the Internet standard

0:02:44.003,0:02:46.033
drawing users to its other products

0:02:46.033,0:02:49.031
and restoring the company's sagging fortunes.

0:02:49.084,0:02:52.040
Our story focuses on team of engineers

0:02:52.040,0:02:54.040
who will come together in this building

0:02:54.053,0:02:56.040
Over the course of the next year

0:02:56.040,0:02:59.058
they will turn their lives inside-out to create Mozilla

0:02:59.059,0:03:02.059
and battle a giant competitor to save their company

0:03:02.059,0:03:04.069
and shape the future of computing.

0:03:11.062,0:03:16.000
Right now we have a problem with the work looks like it can't possibly be done

0:03:16.000,0:03:19.024
for the date we announced

0:03:19.024,0:03:21.012
so were just trying to

0:03:22.040,0:03:26.008
drill down on how doomed we are

0:03:26.008,0:03:30.050
and sometimes the only way to do that is

0:03:30.050,0:03:32.083
to get everybody in the room and stare each other in the eyes.

0:03:32.083,0:03:35.074
We said were giving you Netscape Communicator on 3/31

0:03:35.074,0:03:38.063
so if were not giving them Netscape Communicator on 3/31

0:03:38.063,0:03:40.003
we need a way to address that.

0:03:41.046,0:03:44.088
The goal is to get Mozilla to developpers by March 31th

0:03:44.088,0:03:46.088
a few shorts weeks from now

0:03:46.088,0:03:50.008
it is one of the most ambitious schedules in the company history.

0:03:50.008,0:03:50.099
- It's a joke

0:03:50.099,0:03:51.094
- I think we have been very exclusive

0:03:59.021,0:04:02.040
Michael Toy one of Netscape's first employees

0:04:02.040,0:04:05.044
heads the team that will prepare Mozilla for public release.

0:04:08.040,0:04:10.066
We're probably doomed, we're probably gonna fail

0:04:10.066,0:04:13.005
Microsoft is probably gonna squish us like bug anyway

0:04:13.005,0:04:15.015
but just cause were doomed doesn't mean

0:04:15.015,0:04:18.017
you know we cant get up in the morning and do work

0:04:18.079,0:04:21.007
All rise

0:04:21.079,0:04:24.080
the honorable Michael Toy presiding.

0:04:26.063,0:04:29.014
I'm pretty flip with my kids about what I do.

0:04:29.014,0:04:32.031
What do you do at work dad? Oh I don't know I sit in meetings

0:04:32.031,0:04:34.073
and feel depressed and I read e-mail.

0:04:34.073,0:04:36.048
Oh oh you got me!

0:04:36.048,0:04:38.095
But they think my office is the greatest place in the world though

0:04:38.095,0:04:40.069
It's like "Oh were going to your office?"

0:04:40.069,0:04:43.033
"Oh yeah yippie I love going to your office!"

0:04:43.033,0:04:46.032
They play with the guns and there is free soda

0:04:46.032,0:04:48.032
and there is the giant balls

0:04:48.032,0:04:51.055
basically I work at Disneyland as far as they're concerned.

0:04:51.055,0:04:54.002
I talk about marathon versus sprint.

0:04:54.002,0:04:57.020
The hard part is to run with significant intensity the all way

0:04:57.020,0:04:59.057
knowing that if you ever start walking

0:04:59.057,0:05:02.039
you're not going to make it and just keep the end in sight

0:05:02.039,0:05:04.039
and know that there's this urgency.

0:05:04.087,0:05:07.083
Jim Roskind an expert on software security

0:05:07.083,0:05:11.042
is brought in to enforce rigorous standards of engineering precision.

0:05:11.042,0:05:13.025
Imagine if you had a project

0:05:13.025,0:05:15.020
where you felt doom was imminent

0:05:15.020,0:05:16.088
all the different players wondering

0:05:16.088,0:05:18.045
are they pushed beyond their level

0:05:18.045,0:05:20.045
can they think of way of running faster,

0:05:20.045,0:05:21.048
can anyone help them?

0:05:21.056,0:05:23.037
So there's lot of tension

0:05:23.037,0:05:26.006
and anxiety over making the schedule.

0:05:26.062,0:05:29.055
Jamie Zawinski, free source code evangelist

0:05:29.055,0:05:32.069
will enlist outside developers to Netscape's cause.

0:05:33.007,0:05:36.018
The free source thing is trying to change the rules, right.

0:05:36.056,0:05:39.056
There are people who have the free software religion,

0:05:39.056,0:05:41.094
the one thing they have in common is they're all hackers

0:05:42.036,0:05:45.037
they all like writing code

0:05:45.074,0:05:48.080
so you hoping to tap in to all of those smart people

0:05:48.080,0:05:51.068
and get something from them, you know, so that everyone benefits.

0:05:56.041,0:05:59.001
I'm talking about two millions, two and half millions lines of code

0:05:59.001,0:06:01.001
and everyone of them has to be gone over

0:06:01.001,0:06:03.027
carefully and in some cases twice.

0:06:07.068,0:06:10.022
With hundreds of engineers converging on Mozilla,

0:06:10.022,0:06:12.022
with new code to enable its release,

0:06:12.022,0:06:13.085
Tara Hernandez makes sure

0:06:13.085,0:06:15.094
that their changes do not crash Mozilla

0:06:15.095,0:06:17.087
and brings everyones work to a halt.

0:06:18.025,0:06:19.025
This is how we keep track

0:06:19.025,0:06:20.080
of all the changes that are going in.

0:06:20.080,0:06:22.018
Green is good.

0:06:24.017,0:06:25.051
Lot of changes going on right here,

0:06:25.051,0:06:27.033
and wham, the build all died.

0:06:27.033,0:06:29.062
Ok, alright, bye.

0:06:33.074,0:06:35.036
We're doomed.

0:06:35.066,0:06:38.095
Some of the worst crashes are reserved for Scott Collins

0:06:38.095,0:06:40.093
a veteran code writer who stands by

0:06:40.093,0:06:42.097
for late night troubleshooting.

0:06:46.022,0:06:48.017
I've been here for about

0:06:48.017,0:06:50.017
I don't know, 60 hours or so.

0:06:50.017,0:06:52.048
Writing software is different from

0:06:52.048,0:06:54.048
selling real estate.

0:06:54.088,0:06:56.060
Selling real estate you sell the people

0:06:56.060,0:06:58.000
the people sleep at night.

0:06:58.049,0:07:00.081
When they go to sleep you have to stop selling real estate

0:07:00.081,0:07:02.027
Computers never sleep.

0:07:06.000,0:07:08.017
You can see my cube is decked out a little bit better than

0:07:08.017,0:07:10.017
all the people's.

0:07:11.016,0:07:13.033
I have a nice couch

0:07:13.033,0:07:15.060
little mattress under there I can sleep in

0:07:15.060,0:07:17.016
artwork from my children

0:07:17.016,0:07:18.075
I have control the light switches.

0:07:18.075,0:07:21.074
This is what I'd like to get if my wife truly love me

0:07:21.074,0:07:23.043
she'd let me have one.

0:07:24.048,0:07:25.063
Life is good.

0:07:30.073,0:07:31.048
Ok

0:07:32.049,0:07:33.043
Bug count.

0:07:33.043,0:07:37.000
Alright, there are a ton of bugs on here that

0:07:37.000,0:07:39.012
people just aren't doing anything about.

0:07:39.036,0:07:40.056
To give away its code

0:07:40.056,0:07:43.074
Netscape engineers must make thousands of bug fixes

0:07:43.074,0:07:45.098
Often minute changes that will allow the code

0:07:45.098,0:07:48.030
to be used by outside developpers.

0:07:48.067,0:07:50.087
Jeff Weinstein has, one, two,

0:07:50.087,0:07:52.026
three, four, five, six,

0:07:52.026,0:07:53.075
seven, eight, nine, ten,

0:07:53.075,0:07:55.070
eleven, twelve, thirteen.

0:07:55.070,0:07:57.085
One bug hidden in the mass of code

0:07:57.085,0:07:59.043
can stop everyone else's work

0:07:59.043,0:08:01.001
and can threaten the ship date.

0:08:01.001,0:08:03.027
I need someone to page Jeff Weinstein

0:08:03.031,0:08:05.024
and get him to call 2024.

0:08:05.031,0:08:08.000
Even a team of twenty people building a car

0:08:08.000,0:08:10.013
it's easy to step back fourty feet and look and go

0:08:10.013,0:08:12.013
"Hold it, that guy has not putting on the wheel"

0:08:12.032,0:08:14.054
You have fourty programmers working

0:08:14.054,0:08:17.016
they all come to you with code, a gigantic morass

0:08:17.016,0:08:19.068
of little details piled up on a disc

0:08:19.068,0:08:22.002
usually can even see the pieces whether they're doing it correctly

0:08:22.002,0:08:23.055
You have to assemble it into a whole

0:08:23.055,0:08:25.004
and then see if the whole works

0:08:25.004,0:08:27.031
and then you're not even sure of who gave you the bad bits.

0:08:31.087,0:08:33.085
That would be bad. Let's go downstairs, come on!

0:08:33.085,0:08:35.049
You're talking about a recipe.

0:08:35.049,0:08:37.001
Who gave you the bad flour.

0:08:37.001,0:08:38.039
Someone went out to grind flour,

0:08:38.039,0:08:39.072
and they had to all be exactly

0:08:39.072,0:08:41.065
the right size chunks of flour.

0:08:41.065,0:08:42.096
Someone else made chocolate chips,

0:08:42.096,0:08:44.096
they all had to be exactly the right size chunks.

0:08:44.096,0:08:46.084
You can't figure it out until you put it all together

0:08:46.084,0:08:47.087
you hand it out, and people go.

0:08:47.087,0:08:49.034
"I don't like the way this tastes"

0:08:51.030,0:08:52.039
And now you have to wonder,

0:08:52.039,0:08:54.015
with all these details coming together

0:08:54.015,0:08:55.084
which was the problem

0:08:55.084,0:08:57.084
who's causing the problem, how can you fix it?

0:08:57.084,0:09:00.039
You've got to ship on a certain time.

0:09:00.039,0:09:02.039
And now you have all this people,

0:09:02.039,0:09:04.099
you have the clock ticking and it gets pretty intense.

0:09:05.099,0:09:06.070
Since Netscape began

0:09:06.070,0:09:08.051
the amount of code making up Mozilla

0:09:08.051,0:09:10.051
has increased by a factor of 30.

0:09:11.025,0:09:13.036
The job of programming and debugging it

0:09:13.036,0:09:16.040
rests upon a precarious balance of science and art.

0:09:18.063,0:09:21.078
They talk about what they do as if

0:09:21.078,0:09:24.088
it was a kind of alchemy, a kind of wizardry.

0:09:25.037,0:09:27.098
It does remind me of athletics in that way.

0:09:27.098,0:09:30.003
You know why is someone a good baseball hitter?

0:09:30.055,0:09:33.021
Often the hitters themselves can't really explain it.

0:09:33.074,0:09:36.000
And often the best software people

0:09:36.000,0:09:39.060
cannot themselves understand why they're so good at it.

0:09:40.048,0:09:44.003
But I think make a great programmer is being raised techie.

0:09:44.003,0:09:47.004
My particular team at Netscape, I think we all grew up techie

0:09:47.004,0:09:51.012
We all grew up with computers around us somewhere,

0:09:51.012,0:09:54.013
so that we were exposed to them before we became

0:09:54.090,0:09:57.071
adults, if any of us are really adults

0:09:57.071,0:09:59.071
Jim is the most grownup of us.

0:10:02.000,0:10:05.027
A lot of my childhood from roughly age 6 to age 17

0:10:05.027,0:10:06.046
was around here.

0:10:06.077,0:10:09.071
Life was just a nightmare, this is a very, very scary place

0:10:09.071,0:10:11.061
the two school wasn't too bad.

0:10:11.061,0:10:13.087
Ah, but it meant it

0:10:13.087,0:10:16.070
you'd get to work on puzzles and problems.

0:10:17.091,0:10:20.032
All of the puzzling is math,

0:10:20.032,0:10:22.087
and that puzzling is the exact same feeling

0:10:22.087,0:10:24.053
the exact same problem that you go through

0:10:24.053,0:10:25.063
when you're programming.

0:10:26.050,0:10:29.079
When I was young it'd be building with erector sets and Lego

0:10:30.003,0:10:33.010
now the structures that you build are in software.

0:10:34.008,0:10:36.033
My mom is a first class geek too.

0:10:36.083,0:10:39.071
And so I have a unique experience of being able to talk

0:10:40.011,0:10:42.096
shop with my mom, cuz' she's a director of

0:10:42.096,0:10:45.039
really important stuff at Sun.

0:10:47.092,0:10:50.087
At Netscape one of the code words for is the average person

0:10:50.087,0:10:52.011
who is going to be able to use this software is,

0:10:52.011,0:10:54.011
"Well can my mom use it?"

0:10:54.083,0:10:56.050
Yeah, my mom can use it.

0:10:56.050,0:10:58.050
My mom can write optimizing compilers.

0:11:02.002,0:11:04.067
By the time I was 12 years old I was making 50 bucks an hour

0:11:04.067,0:11:05.095
programming computers.

0:11:06.075,0:11:10.062
People say what should I be should I grow up to be a...

0:11:10.062,0:11:12.009
I say computer programmer.

0:11:16.033,0:11:19.074
The thing about that makes it a youth culture

0:11:19.074,0:11:23.023
is one's capacity to throw one's entire life on the line

0:11:23.023,0:11:24.049
with these firms

0:11:25.051,0:11:27.082
Entire life commitment meaning

0:11:27.082,0:11:30.086
24-7-365 work commitment.

0:11:33.003,0:11:34.067
It's throwing yourself into a thing

0:11:34.067,0:11:36.084
where you don't know if that job

0:11:36.084,0:11:38.012
is going to be around soon.

0:11:38.012,0:11:40.000
There's no stability in here.

0:11:40.000,0:11:43.045
So the very kind of weird irony

0:11:43.045,0:11:45.061
is that very people who are inventing the future

0:11:45.061,0:11:46.066
can't see their own future.

0:11:47.092,0:11:49.074
This is a monk-life existence

0:11:49.074,0:11:51.092
there are very few women in these societies.

0:11:51.092,0:11:54.005
These are male societies,

0:11:54.005,0:11:55.075
they are secret societies,

0:11:55.075,0:11:58.059
they function very much like the Masons

0:11:58.059,0:12:00.079
or some street gang.

0:12:00.079,0:12:01.085
Evil!

0:12:03.084,0:12:05.055
Evil! Evil!

0:12:05.055,0:12:06.032
Evil man!

0:12:06.032,0:12:07.014
Why am I an evil man?

0:12:07.079,0:12:08.086
Did you or did you not hear a man saying

0:12:08.086,0:12:10.086
if you have a source leaving one bug, you will be

0:12:10.086,0:12:11.063
in here at 1:30.

0:12:11.063,0:12:13.003
I thought it was 2:30

0:12:14.032,0:12:15.079
Now you're evil and stupid.

0:12:15.079,0:12:16.044
(laughs)

0:12:16.044,0:12:18.000
You now that, I'm actually just in a different time zone.

0:12:18.000,0:12:20.015
I thought stupidity was an excuse though.

0:12:20.046,0:12:22.091
A lot of people at Netscape don't get out much

0:12:22.091,0:12:25.012
because they're at work all the time but

0:12:25.012,0:12:27.045
most of people's social interaction I would expect is

0:12:27.045,0:12:29.045
revolves around work just because

0:12:29.045,0:12:31.091
so many people spend so much of their time at work.

0:12:31.091,0:12:33.039
Hi Chris, it's Tara

0:12:33.084,0:12:35.008
um, how much do you love me?

0:12:36.032,0:12:37.003
Good.

0:12:37.003,0:12:38.067
What do you know about way the threading stuff

0:12:38.067,0:12:41.003
that falls into Javascript stuff and Java makes it feed?

0:12:42.000,0:12:43.091
All we have left to hold on to, really

0:12:43.091,0:12:46.008
is the work place, I mean it is the modern village.

0:12:47.030,0:12:49.030
People get to know your history

0:12:49.030,0:12:52.035
they shrug at your bad jokes.

0:12:53.069,0:12:55.071
There's a kind of familiarity that

0:12:55.071,0:12:58.037
and continuity that we don't have elsewhere.

0:12:58.037,0:12:59.048
Paul

0:12:59.048,0:13:02.000
we're going  go out in a while and get something to eat

0:13:02.000,0:13:04.040
and do stupid things. You're interested?

0:13:04.040,0:13:05.085
Sure. Sure. Right.

0:13:06.049,0:13:09.008
Ok, the purpose of this meeting is not to beat up people

0:13:09.008,0:13:11.023
the purpose of this meeting is to make sure that

0:13:11.023,0:13:13.065
as a company we are incredibly focused on

0:13:13.065,0:13:15.039
getting the bug count to 0

0:13:15.072,0:13:18.075
we've been moderately focused up until now

0:13:18.075,0:13:20.091
we need to be deadly focused

0:13:20.091,0:13:21.063
from here on in.

0:13:21.063,0:13:24.053
Ok Jeff Weinstein

0:13:24.053,0:13:26.053
is he in this room?

0:13:27.072,0:13:28.083
He's not in this room.

0:13:28.083,0:13:31.023
Did not check-in this weekend, true or false?

0:13:31.023,0:13:32.079
He did not check-in this weekend

0:13:32.079,0:13:33.091
He did not answer his mail

0:13:33.091,0:13:35.048
and he hasn't answered his phone yet either.

0:13:35.048,0:13:37.084
His locator shows he's with the rest of the colonists

0:13:37.084,0:13:39.084
(laughs)

0:13:39.096,0:13:42.051
The old saying is that trying to manage programmers

0:13:42.051,0:13:44.051
is like trying to herd cats.

0:13:44.051,0:13:46.051
You know you want them to be cats

0:13:46.051,0:13:49.028
if you like cats, I mean 'cause you want what's unique about

0:13:49.028,0:13:50.067
that creature

0:13:50.067,0:13:54.022
But they really don't all like to go in the same direction.

0:13:55.024,0:13:56.091
In less than four years

0:13:56.091,0:13:59.041
Netscape has grown from a handful of people

0:13:59.041,0:14:00.072
to over 200

0:14:00.072,0:14:02.087
and sometimes, locating a programmer

0:14:02.087,0:14:04.036
become yet another obstacle

0:14:04.036,0:14:06.022
for the browser team to overcome.

0:14:06.022,0:14:07.036
I'd say he's not in there.

0:14:07.036,0:14:09.071
That would be my guess, straight out.

0:14:09.071,0:14:11.021
He's not there.

0:14:11.092,0:14:14.003
When's the last time he was in here?

0:14:14.003,0:14:15.015
This afternoon.

0:14:15.015,0:14:16.075
Ok

0:14:16.075,0:14:19.089
Tara and I are ready to take a hit out on him.

0:14:19.089,0:14:22.070
and well if ya see him when he comes back tell him to

0:14:22.070,0:14:25.072
panic and run around and we're like

0:14:25.072,0:14:26.066
doomed on Mac right now with this thing.

0:14:27.075,0:14:27.076
Doomed!

0:14:27.079,0:14:31.032
The person working on Mac is like waiting for data right?

0:14:31.032,0:14:34.049
You should go around to every person in the company saying, "Doomed!"

0:14:36.066,0:14:39.047
Netscape predicament has much to do with this man

0:14:39.047,0:14:42.015
Bill Gates, whose company, Microsoft

0:14:42.015,0:14:44.015
has made him the richest, and arguably

0:14:44.015,0:14:46.015
the most powerful man in the world.

0:14:47.041,0:14:49.071
Allright if we can have order we'd like to begin.

0:14:49.091,0:14:51.041
Viewing Netscape's browser

0:14:51.041,0:14:53.078
as a potential threat to his computing empire

0:14:53.078,0:14:55.045
Gates has moved swiftly,

0:14:55.045,0:14:57.017
making his own browser free

0:14:57.065,0:14:58.096
and Netscape claims,

0:14:58.096,0:15:01.067
also engaging an unfair business practices

0:15:01.067,0:15:03.067
to take away its customers.

0:15:03.067,0:15:05.017
But we need to explore today

0:15:05.017,0:15:06.067
whether you and your company

0:15:06.067,0:15:08.020
have crossed the line

0:15:08.020,0:15:09.087
or on the other hand

0:15:09.087,0:15:12.048
whether this is just the carping of disgruntled rivals.

0:15:12.066,0:15:15.004
Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale

0:15:15.004,0:15:17.041
argues his company's case before the Senate.

0:15:17.041,0:15:19.051
And certainly nobody here on this panel is

0:15:19.051,0:15:20.088
a greater admirer of Mr. Gates

0:15:20.088,0:15:22.029
or his company than I am.

0:15:22.029,0:15:24.012
But we do ask that Microsoft

0:15:24.012,0:15:25.008
be held accountable

0:15:25.008,0:15:26.000
for some of their actions.

0:15:26.005,0:15:29.037
Actions that intimidate PC OEM manufacturers

0:15:29.037,0:15:32.039
to use their products and exclusionary practises

0:15:32.039,0:15:34.033
that prevent them from using my products.

0:15:34.033,0:15:36.033
Not all companies succeed.

0:15:36.033,0:15:38.053
Some fail to embrace change.

0:15:39.012,0:15:42.075
This is the way technology in the free market works.

0:15:43.014,0:15:45.051
The software industry's success

0:15:45.051,0:15:48.039
has not been driven by government regulation

0:15:48.066,0:15:51.067
but by freedom and the basic human desire

0:15:51.067,0:15:54.036
to learn, to innovate and to excel.

0:15:54.036,0:15:56.050
Meanwhile thousand of miles away

0:15:56.050,0:15:59.050
Netscape programmers continue working around the clock

0:15:59.050,0:16:01.063
in a race to meet Mozilla's release date.

0:16:02.015,0:16:04.060
These guys they tend to work very consistently,

0:16:04.060,0:16:06.086
so they'll just keep working until it's done and they won't stop.

0:16:07.021,0:16:09.004
They don't need food, they don't need sleep,

0:16:09.004,0:16:10.000
they don't need anything

0:16:10.000,0:16:13.012
OK, so they take pay, but...

0:16:14.070,0:16:17.004
A while ago some people from Harvard came and said

0:16:17.004,0:16:19.004
"Well how do you develop software, we're writing a book" and I

0:16:19.025,0:16:20.064
and I talked about all the things I thought

0:16:20.064,0:16:22.000
were really important and they were just

0:16:22.000,0:16:24.020
it felt to me like they were shaking their heads going,

0:16:24.020,0:16:26.024
Oh, gee, he doesn't know about Principle 7

0:16:26.024,0:16:28.003
and oh, he doesn't know about Principle 22

0:16:28.003,0:16:30.057
and in some ways they're right... I really haven't got a clue.

0:16:30.057,0:16:33.037
Right I really like to err on the side of

0:16:33.037,0:16:35.061
every day we wake up in the morning and say

0:16:35.061,0:16:37.072
based on what I know today

0:16:37.072,0:16:40.075
what's the best way to get to where we all want to go?

0:16:41.067,0:16:44.005
I personally or me and you three of us

0:16:44.033,0:16:46.083
do no have time to read all two millions of source code

0:16:46.083,0:16:49.024
to see that, there are no remaining problems.

0:16:52.020,0:16:53.055
We're going over here

0:16:53.055,0:16:55.087
zeroing in on Jeff Weinstein.

0:16:56.067,0:16:59.001
With March 31st only days away

0:16:59.001,0:17:01.078
the team can't proceed until Jeff Weinstein

0:17:01.078,0:17:04.089
an expert on some of Netscapes most arcane code

0:17:04.089,0:17:07.069
finds time to complete the bug fixes on his list.

0:17:07.083,0:17:08.059
How are you doing?

0:17:08.059,0:17:09.036
OK

0:17:09.071,0:17:10.059
Alright well

0:17:10.059,0:17:12.027
you are officially the most doomed

0:17:12.027,0:17:14.027
individual in the company sir

0:17:18.042,0:17:21.048
this one I can close, same with this one

0:17:21.048,0:17:23.048
yeah bunch of these

0:17:23.048,0:17:26.010
Um hopefully I'll get most of it done tonight

0:17:26.010,0:17:28.002
His goal he was just going to stay all night

0:17:28.002,0:17:29.044
and he was going to get it all done.

0:17:29.044,0:17:31.066
The good news is actually I think by about

0:17:31.093,0:17:34.010
I'm not sure if it was 9 or 11 o'clock at night

0:17:34.010,0:17:36.010
he actually was completely done.

0:17:38.051,0:17:40.020
Yeah!

0:17:40.020,0:17:41.068
Reaching a critical milestone

0:17:41.068,0:17:43.072
is cause for celebration.

0:17:46.099,0:17:49.009
And one bug left

0:17:49.009,0:17:51.006
and it's a really really hard one

0:17:51.006,0:17:53.027
Don't make me kill you, close 4330.

0:17:53.027,0:17:54.092
I will close 4330.

0:17:56.024,0:17:57.063
Bug count is small

0:17:57.079,0:18:00.000
there are some bugs that are not currently closed

0:18:00.000,0:18:02.048
but most of them are like piddly little annoying things that

0:18:02.048,0:18:03.057
Some of its stuck!

0:18:09.000,0:18:12.075
All praise the uh the mighty ones that created tremendous pile of

0:18:12.075,0:18:16.020
people working really hard this week to do the impossible.

0:18:18.041,0:18:20.088
There is this magic phrase that Michael Toy invented

0:18:20.088,0:18:22.088
which is "Zarro Boogs", hum

0:18:22.088,0:18:24.067
which is it's not quite perfect

0:18:24.067,0:18:26.000
but it's perfect enough

0:18:26.000,0:18:27.054
as zero bugs / "zarro boogs".

0:18:27.074,0:18:30.045
Do you have a spare monitor upstairs?

0:18:30.050,0:18:32.022
Yes I do have a spare monitor.

0:18:32.035,0:18:34.014
This is the first big test

0:18:34.027,0:18:37.068
Will an outsider actually be able to make Mozilla work?

0:18:37.072,0:18:42.008
If not Netscape stands a good chance of missing its March 31st deadline

0:18:42.029,0:18:43.081
I thought it's gonna be huge thing,

0:18:43.081,0:18:44.051
I thought it's gonna be like a hundred,

0:18:44.051,0:18:46.074
two hundred people here like all and rows

0:18:46.074,0:18:49.052
like with soviet style.

0:18:49.052,0:18:51.052
We are nowhere near that organized

0:18:53.001,0:18:55.038
Looks like it's all here, here we go!

0:18:56.039,0:19:00.041
Wow! All good, it's pretty simple how stuff is built.

0:19:00.041,0:19:03.017
It's just there's set of scripts that are set up

0:19:03.017,0:19:05.024
to say exactly what to compile and then

0:19:05.029,0:19:08.025
they all get globbed together into Mozilla hopefully.

0:19:10.015,0:19:11.071
- Here it is[br]- Yeah

0:19:11.071,0:19:14.072
If you get it to work, then it means anybody can get it to work.

0:19:14.072,0:19:15.050
That's true.

0:19:22.089,0:19:28.039
(WILD CHEERING clapping laughter)

0:19:31.005,0:19:34.034
- And look It has an about face![br]- ...Look it's so cute...

0:19:35.068,0:19:39.011
- Oh, that was pretty

0:19:39.011,0:19:41.058
- Yeah it's...[br]- No, I don't think it's working.

0:19:41.061,0:19:44.048
- Well go to the..[br]- Well[br]- Oh...[br]- Big crash...

0:19:44.048,0:19:46.048
- Hell shot the foot...

0:19:49.099,0:19:51.008
It's actually going really well.

0:19:51.008,0:19:52.050
I didn't think we'd actually get somebody

0:19:52.050,0:19:53.061
to build this quickly.

0:19:53.061,0:19:56.059
We had to do one small adjustment and it worked!

0:19:57.070,0:19:59.072
With the source almost ready to ship,

0:19:59.072,0:20:01.075
Netscape must explain the significance

0:20:01.075,0:20:03.034
of Mozilla to the press.

0:20:03.034,0:20:06.047
Basically what we wanna do is we wanna give them a little bit of the history

0:20:07.031,0:20:11.085
and then we wanna go into the what's actually going to happen tomorrow.

0:20:11.098,0:20:14.035
The other important take away then too from this

0:20:14.035,0:20:20.008
is that this is a really exciting cool thing.

0:20:20.008,0:20:24.079
- Good afternoon, Forrester[br]- Hi Stan Dolberg and uh Eric Brown please.

0:20:24.079,0:20:26.004
- One second.

0:20:27.083,0:20:31.075
- You've reached voicemail for Stan Dolberg -- I'll transfer you now

0:20:32.021,0:20:33.091
- Good afternoon, Forrester.

0:20:33.091,0:20:35.024
- Hi this is Maggie Young.

0:20:35.024,0:20:37.005
I'm calling from Netscape and I have scheduled

0:20:37.005,0:20:39.067
conference call with Stan Dolberg and Eric Brown

0:20:39.067,0:20:41.071
and I just got Stan's voicemail.

0:20:41.071,0:20:44.095
Netscape hopes the press will greet Mozilla with the same enthusiasm

0:20:44.095,0:20:48.034
it had for the company in its early days.

0:20:48.034,0:20:53.038
At eleven AM this morning, Netscape's stock went public and Wall Street went bonkers.

0:20:53.043,0:20:56.013
Initially offer had a price of 38 $ a share,

0:20:56.013,0:20:58.040
Netscape shut up to 72 within minutes...

0:20:58.040,0:21:01.085
The stock is bid up at extraordinary levels

0:21:01.085,0:21:05.003
in the first couple of really days and weeks

0:21:05.003,0:21:06.051
of its introduction.

0:21:06.051,0:21:09.028
It is the biggest initial public offering

0:21:09.028,0:21:11.090
in basically the Wall Street history.

0:21:16.015,0:21:17.072
- Good afternoon, Forrester

0:21:19.000,0:21:20.031
- Hi this is Josh Walker.

0:21:20.031,0:21:24.007
Today less than three years after its record breaking IPO however,

0:21:24.007,0:21:27.002
Netscape's story generates a different response.

0:21:27.002,0:21:28.013
- Hi there[br]- Yup

0:21:28.013,0:21:30.076
- As you now tomorrow is March 31st

0:21:30.076,0:21:33.080
- So that means hum, source code will be made

0:21:33.080,0:21:35.080
available to the developer community.

0:21:35.080,0:21:36.081
And we thought we would just

0:21:36.081,0:21:38.075
catch you up to speed and walk you through

0:21:38.075,0:21:41.005
that and see if you had some questions.

0:21:41.005,0:21:45.058
- Either I'm braindead or it takes lot of effort to communicate

0:21:45.083,0:21:49.050
and so I'm concerned that while you all know

0:21:49.050,0:21:53.039
what it means, I'm not confident

0:21:53.039,0:21:56.083
that it's coming across to the press.

0:21:56.083,0:21:58.064
- Right, I think those are good points.

0:21:58.064,0:22:02.033
By opening up the source code, we basically extend our developer community

0:22:02.033,0:22:04.027
from those folks that are inside of Netscape

0:22:04.027,0:22:05.081
to hundreds and thousands of developers

0:22:05.081,0:22:06.086
outside of Netscape

0:22:06.086,0:22:09.073
so it's no longer Netscape versus Microsoft.

0:22:09.073,0:22:12.011
It's Netscape and all of the Netscape,

0:22:12.011,0:22:13.088
you know, virtual community.

0:22:13.088,0:22:17.030
- I think there is a belief that Netscape

0:22:17.030,0:22:20.002
doesn't have a position to continue

0:22:20.002,0:22:21.085
to compete with Microsoft

0:22:21.085,0:22:24.051
in the browser front and that

0:22:24.051,0:22:27.083
in essence you've given up on the browser position.

0:22:32.005,0:22:35.050
This was a lot more smooth than I had originally anticipated.

0:22:35.050,0:22:36.023
Really.

0:22:38.026,0:22:40.072
I'm still waiting for the major bump in the road

0:22:40.072,0:22:42.033
that's gonna happen some time between now

0:22:42.033,0:22:43.055
and tomorrow afternoon.

0:22:43.055,0:22:45.014
In software development there is

0:22:45.014,0:22:46.057
always a bump in the road.

0:22:46.057,0:22:48.057
We just want to hear the Apple story

0:22:48.057,0:22:53.094
They just can't quite get themselves comfortable

0:22:53.094,0:22:55.098
with the patent grant or with

0:22:55.098,0:22:58.033
whatever we tried to do to fix it for them.

0:22:58.033,0:23:01.043
So the last thing back out of their lawyer was

0:23:01.043,0:23:04.025
"gee, oh I don't know that we get enough protection."

0:23:04.025,0:23:09.008
Mozilla has a small piece of code from Apple that has not been cleared for public license.

0:23:09.017,0:23:11.001
- Ok.[br]- We have to escalate.

0:23:11.076,0:23:13.046
- Hi this is Mark Andreeson,

0:23:13.046,0:23:16.044
I called a few minutes ago, and left message

0:23:16.044,0:23:18.066
we're trying to get - the problem is I can't get phone

0:23:18.066,0:23:19.092
there's no one at the Apple switchboard

0:23:19.092,0:23:21.092
so I'm having a hard time getting phone numbers for people.

0:23:21.092,0:23:22.085
Awesome.

0:23:24.074,0:23:26.025
Hold on, 6 2 0.

0:23:35.002,0:23:37.029
In order to ship Mozilla the next morning,

0:23:37.029,0:23:39.010
Scott Collins is called in

0:23:39.010,0:23:41.036
to replace Apple's code with his own invention.

0:23:41.036,0:23:43.088
And theoretically we believe this is possible.

0:23:43.088,0:23:47.033
It's my last bug. When I complete this bug,

0:23:47.033,0:23:50.090
I will be allowed to rest.

0:23:50.090,0:23:53.075
So I stayed up until about 5:40,

0:23:53.075,0:23:56.073
this morning writing this replacement class.

0:23:56.073,0:23:59.036
It made my life a living hell.

0:23:59.036,0:24:01.039
I got it basically running, it's all running,

0:24:01.039,0:24:03.028
it's all really good, and thank heavens

0:24:03.028,0:24:04.094
we got permission from Apple

0:24:04.094,0:24:06.029
to ship the regular source.

0:24:06.029,0:24:08.023
It's my understanding that Jamie

0:24:08.023,0:24:10.072
is gonna be the person that's gonna be pushing

0:24:10.072,0:24:13.039
the bits up to the website at around 10:00,

0:24:13.039,0:24:14.066
is that correct?

0:24:14.066,0:24:15.075
OK.

0:24:15.075,0:24:18.013
And we're gonna be staging some different

0:24:18.013,0:24:20.057
photo opportunities for the press at that time,

0:24:20.057,0:24:23.015
there will be television cameras you know news crews

0:24:23.015,0:24:25.086
- Couldn't we just like hire actors to do this for us?

0:24:25.086,0:24:30.099
- ...just tell them they get to be on TV come on..[br]- We're not gonna mandate it..

0:24:30.099,0:24:33.075
- You're on TV right now.[br]- We've been on TV for two months.

0:24:33.075,0:24:37.024
- I don't think anyone is gonna come.

0:24:42.035,0:24:44.031
One way to learn to run a marathon

0:24:44.031,0:24:47.060
is put a person out 26 miles into the desert,

0:24:47.060,0:24:49.097
and say, you know, there's this bomb on your back

0:24:49.097,0:24:51.075
that's gonna go off in a certain length of time

0:24:51.075,0:24:53.019
if you don't get into the town.

0:24:53.019,0:24:55.022
Well, that'll motivate you to get in

0:24:55.022,0:24:57.030
but there is a certain chance that you'll be blown up.

0:24:57.030,0:25:00.082
- You know what time it is?[br]- Yeah it's five to ten.

0:25:00.082,0:25:04.010
- Aah! Going to be late. Hurry up!

0:25:04.010,0:25:05.094
Welcome everybody to the conference call.

0:25:05.094,0:25:07.063
Thanks for joining us this morning.

0:25:07.063,0:25:09.063
Today Netscape announced that

0:25:09.063,0:25:12.047
the first developer release of its Communicator 5.0

0:25:12.047,0:25:14.091
source code is available for download

0:25:14.091,0:25:17.011
from the Mozilla dot org website.

0:25:19.022,0:25:21.008
- You know where Tara is?

0:25:21.008,0:25:22.084
- Second floor?

0:25:22.084,0:25:25.048
- It's first floor, way on the other side.

0:25:25.048,0:25:27.017
And then today on the end of March,

0:25:27.017,0:25:29.044
as we announced, we are pushing the code

0:25:29.044,0:25:30.059
out to the Web as they say,

0:25:30.059,0:25:32.004
and we are delighted to be part of it

0:25:32.004,0:25:33.078
and we're very excited to see what happens.

0:25:33.078,0:25:36.025
The good news is the marathoner is now

0:25:36.025,0:25:38.011
coming into town with that bomb on his back

0:25:38.011,0:25:39.036
and it looks like he's gonna make it.

0:25:43.095,0:25:45.067
- This is the moment of truth!

0:25:46.040,0:25:48.055
They don't have theoretical framework

0:25:48.055,0:25:50.063
to write software, they're just writing it.

0:25:55.031,0:25:56.096
It's just like hitting the baseball.

0:25:56.096,0:25:59.091
If their code gets a home run,

0:25:59.091,0:26:01.049
nobody's asking questions.

0:26:01.049,0:26:02.092
Well, this doesn't make sense,

0:26:02.092,0:26:04.045
or why do you that, why does it work.

0:26:04.045,0:26:05.080
Nobody cares why it works.

0:26:17.049,0:26:20.084
- Wait this is bad.[br]- What's that?

0:26:21.000,0:26:25.073
- Well it's not connecting to...[br]- The machine that controls

0:26:25.073,0:26:28.027
the FTP push is, like, not answering.

0:26:28.027,0:26:30.053
- Is it loaded?[br]- It's "blast" not "blash".

0:26:30.071,0:26:33.048
- Oh[br]- Yeah maybe they're...

0:26:37.072,0:26:40.061
- Mac's there. UNIX is there. Windows is there.[br]- We're done!

0:26:40.066,0:26:44.051
- It's on![br]- Yeah!

0:26:54.050,0:26:58.025
- Since Jamie is here, I am told that means

0:26:58.025,0:27:00.057
that we have now pushed the source out on the Net.

0:27:00.057,0:27:01.040
Is that correct?

0:27:01.040,0:27:03.001
- Actually, we decided not to.

0:27:05.068,0:27:07.090
We thought it was a stupid idea.

0:27:11.001,0:27:12.095
- That's our story and were sticking to it.

0:27:25.016,0:27:27.052
For a moment, everyone at Netscape

0:27:27.052,0:27:28.080
takes a breather.

0:27:28.080,0:27:30.082
- I think it's gonna work out.

0:27:31.053,0:27:33.066
In the first hour of its release,

0:27:33.066,0:27:36.052
the source code is downloaded thousands of times

0:27:36.052,0:27:38.071
but the number of downloads is no guarantee

0:27:38.071,0:27:41.066
that Netscape will receive enough valuable contributions

0:27:41.066,0:27:44.013
to help the company to reverse its slide.

0:27:48.003,0:27:50.040
He's known as Pavlov to me. He's Pavlov at

0:27:50.040,0:27:53.049
Pavlov.net, on IRC he's Pavlov or Pav or

0:27:53.049,0:27:57.038
um, Pav Sleeping, or Pav Tired Up Too Late.

0:27:57.038,0:28:00.054
And um without him I think we'd be months behind.

0:28:00.054,0:28:03.043
Netscape's notoriety draws code writers

0:28:03.043,0:28:06.079
from around the world willing to work on Mozilla without pay.

0:28:06.079,0:28:10.050
One such contributor comes from rural Georgia.

0:28:12.072,0:28:15.020
I've been amazed over the last two or three years,

0:28:15.020,0:28:17.042
when especially his mother would come tell me

0:28:17.042,0:28:19.068
"Well, so and so called" from maybe New York

0:28:19.068,0:28:21.009
and they were coming to Atlanta

0:28:21.009,0:28:22.099
and they wanted to talk to Stuart or see him,

0:28:22.099,0:28:24.074
and they were gonna go down and have lunch.

0:28:24.074,0:28:26.092
"Well", I'd say "Who is this person from New York?"

0:28:26.092,0:28:29.067
And the all of a sudden "Well, he's been working

0:28:29.067,0:28:32.004
with Stuart on some programming issues

0:28:32.004,0:28:34.026
for a year or so and he wanted to come down

0:28:34.026,0:28:37.074
and meet. "Well, did you tell him you're only sixteen?"

0:28:37.074,0:28:41.007
I had no idea. Um, and that's great,

0:28:41.007,0:28:43.003
that's a wonderful thing because

0:28:43.003,0:28:47.060
he's contributing. It doesn't matter that he's young.

0:28:47.060,0:28:51.000
The place we call the cave. We just shut the door

0:28:51.000,0:28:55.015
and this is where he does whatever he does.

0:28:55.015,0:28:58.081
It is flabbergasting to think that your child

0:28:58.081,0:29:03.077
has done something for this worldwide company

0:29:03.077,0:29:05.010
instead of his homework.

0:29:05.010,0:29:08.031
I went and looked back at the older code

0:29:08.031,0:29:11.021
and I was really frightened by how

0:29:11.021,0:29:14.009
incredibly messy and just awful the code looked.

0:29:14.009,0:29:15.098
It would have taken you know

0:29:15.098,0:29:18.026
years to try and figure out what it was doing.

0:29:18.026,0:29:21.025
So we basically did it from scratch.

0:29:21.098,0:29:24.038
Pretty much I'm providing the code that makes

0:29:24.038,0:29:26.058
the browser show everything faster

0:29:26.058,0:29:29.020
and more efficiently than it used to.

0:29:29.020,0:29:33.000
His keyboarding is almost just like talking.

0:29:33.000,0:29:36.011
It's just um, an expression.

0:29:36.011,0:29:38.063
He can express himself that way

0:29:38.063,0:29:42.082
and it's just totally unconscious, almost.

0:29:42.082,0:29:45.088
Just a part of how he communicates.

0:29:46.068,0:29:49.063
In the past, free code contributions

0:29:49.063,0:29:51.022
helped build the Internet.

0:29:51.022,0:29:53.015
How commercial enterprise would benefit

0:29:53.015,0:29:55.074
from free code remains a big question.

0:29:55.074,0:29:57.066
Well, it's certainly my hope that

0:29:57.066,0:30:00.075
the enormous amount of new people

0:30:00.075,0:30:02.011
that no one company could afford

0:30:02.011,0:30:03.094
to have working on any product,

0:30:03.094,0:30:06.066
now contributing to the Netscape Navigator

0:30:06.066,0:30:09.056
Communicator will make a significant difference

0:30:09.056,0:30:11.027
in the improvement of the product.

0:30:11.027,0:30:14.072
How that works against any competitor,

0:30:14.072,0:30:16.025
remains to be seen.

0:30:25.098,0:30:27.076
-Good morning[br]-Good morning, Thank you.

0:30:27.076,0:30:31.005
David Readerman an analyst for San Francisco Investment Bank,

0:30:31.005,0:30:33.055
closely monitors Netscape's radical plan

0:30:33.055,0:30:35.031
for investors eager to participate

0:30:35.031,0:30:37.004
in the Internet stock boom.

0:30:38.013,0:30:40.043
The market is really kind of a voting machine,

0:30:40.043,0:30:43.021
it's voting yes I believe that vision statement.

0:30:43.021,0:30:46.050
Yes I believe that's gonna result in products sales.

0:30:46.050,0:30:48.071
Yes that's going to drive earnings up, and

0:30:48.071,0:30:50.071
you know stocks should traded accordingly.

0:30:51.015,0:30:53.025
The financial benefits to Netscape of

0:30:53.025,0:30:55.095
giving away its source code are hard to measure.

0:30:55.095,0:30:58.039
I understand why Netscape's trying to do it.

0:30:58.039,0:31:02.026
They still have to show me that

0:31:02.026,0:31:04.069
behind the vision and the slideware,

0:31:04.069,0:31:08.046
there's a real sustainable business model

0:31:08.046,0:31:11.013
that can deliver earnings hum,

0:31:11.013,0:31:14.055
and so I'm in show-me mode for Netscape.

0:31:20.057,0:31:22.093
Now, my job will be three times

0:31:22.093,0:31:25.088
as hard as it was yesterday and it was already ten times harder than it needed to be.

0:31:25.088,0:31:29.005
Right? Did I just work really hard to ship

0:31:29.005,0:31:31.013
the company jewels out of the building and

0:31:31.013,0:31:33.020
it's just gonna end in us dying

0:31:33.020,0:31:35.052
and rolling in poison and misery.

0:31:35.052,0:31:37.046
The day after this stuff goes out,

0:31:37.046,0:31:38.058
you really don't get to let up.

0:31:38.058,0:31:41.015
There is then the sort of day in day out,

0:31:41.015,0:31:45.008
go to work turn on the computer, code, code code.

0:31:45.008,0:31:46.094
- Thanks Tara.

0:31:49.046,0:31:50.053
- Tara?

0:31:50.068,0:31:52.095
- Yeah what's your doctor say Tara?

0:31:52.095,0:31:55.081
- Uh, my doctor says interestingly enough

0:31:55.081,0:31:59.081
that I work too much

0:31:59.081,0:32:02.025
and uh, that if I went to work today after

0:32:02.025,0:32:04.047
my appointment he would personally kill me.

0:32:04.047,0:32:07.075
I have an agreement with myself

0:32:07.075,0:32:10.002
that by the time I'm 35, I'm either going

0:32:10.002,0:32:11.084
to be high school teacher or bartender,

0:32:11.084,0:32:13.095
but something, anything other than a

0:32:13.095,0:32:16.007
in a position in the hightech industry,

0:32:16.007,0:32:18.011
otherwise I'll probably die by the time I'm 40.

0:32:25.073,0:32:27.046
Uh, now that I'm an old guy

0:32:27.046,0:32:28.058
I've kind of been round the block

0:32:28.058,0:32:32.084
couple times and you can go from realizing,

0:32:32.084,0:32:34.049
"This just never stops, does it?"

0:32:34.049,0:32:37.022
And that being really depressing

0:32:37.022,0:32:38.092
because you feel like it "I'm on, I'm on".

0:32:38.092,0:32:40.068
I said I was never going to be on the treadmill

0:32:40.068,0:32:42.060
and here I am. I'm on the treadmill.

0:32:42.060,0:32:44.084
I'm going to be running like this forever.

0:32:44.084,0:32:46.098
Because they're good at software,

0:32:46.098,0:32:48.094
they need to keep pace.

0:32:48.094,0:32:51.005
And as a result, keeping pace means

0:32:51.005,0:32:53.090
to shut a lot of other things out.

0:32:53.090,0:32:55.059
They just don't have time to read,

0:32:55.059,0:32:57.014
time to hear about the world.

0:32:57.014,0:32:59.008
They don't have much time for their families.

0:32:59.008,0:33:00.082
Um, but when you're in situation where

0:33:00.082,0:33:02.080
you really have a lot of work to do

0:33:02.080,0:33:04.008
and no time to do it,

0:33:05.001,0:33:07.003
you know, you pick what you want.

0:33:07.003,0:33:08.076
Some people pick wanting to have a family.

0:33:08.076,0:33:10.001
Some people pick wanting to

0:33:10.001,0:33:11.011
get some software done.

0:33:12.040,0:33:16.079
Christopher was born right after I started at Netscape,

0:33:16.079,0:33:19.034
and I basically missed the first

0:33:19.034,0:33:21.071
two years of his life because of the intensity.

0:33:21.071,0:33:23.052
I'd work 'til about 7 or 8 o'clock,

0:33:23.052,0:33:25.027
come home, eat dinner,

0:33:25.027,0:33:28.051
put the kids to bed, and then go back to work,

0:33:28.051,0:33:30.039
or work from home, until 2 or 3

0:33:30.039,0:33:32.057
in the morning, and was like the Dad zombie.

0:33:32.057,0:33:35.016
He would call and say, I'm on my way home

0:33:35.016,0:33:37.002
and then it would be 2 or 3 hours and

0:33:37.002,0:33:39.029
you know, the romantic dinner candles

0:33:39.029,0:33:40.009
had burned down

0:33:40.009,0:33:41.069
and I was thinking he was dead

0:33:41.069,0:33:43.001
by the side of the road so,

0:33:43.001,0:33:45.015
you know if 24 hours goes by

0:33:45.015,0:33:47.010
and I don't hear from him,

0:33:47.010,0:33:48.059
that I pretty much know where to find him.

0:33:50.045,0:33:53.008
I live in Michigan. And I commute.

0:33:53.008,0:33:55.052
So it's quite a long commute,

0:33:55.052,0:33:57.023
I don't make it every day.

0:33:57.023,0:33:59.050
I only make it about every two weeks or so.

0:33:59.050,0:34:03.048
But um, It is quite a time change.

0:34:03.048,0:34:06.028
Here it's something like 12:01

0:34:06.028,0:34:09.032
in the morning, and there it's 1954.

0:34:15.071,0:34:18.042
The motivation from moving back here is

0:34:18.042,0:34:21.013
I wanted to get into a community,

0:34:21.013,0:34:25.021
put roots down, and you know, feel settled.

0:34:25.021,0:34:28.090
And I...Life is just different out there,

0:34:28.090,0:34:31.096
it really is. I mean here people like worked

0:34:31.096,0:34:36.000
car factory or whatever... thirty years and out.

0:34:38.094,0:34:42.001
We spent, like, 45 minutes talking about all his

0:34:42.001,0:34:44.090
like, his whole story, from job, to job, to job, to job.

0:34:44.090,0:34:46.021
I thought it was pretty cool.

0:34:47.071,0:34:53.032
He had like ten or something, jobs.

0:34:53.059,0:34:56.076
He seemed to do it a lot during particularly peak

0:34:56.076,0:34:59.048
stressful times, like, you know, baby due

0:34:59.048,0:35:01.044
in two months, I'm changing jobs now, dear.

0:35:01.044,0:35:03.021
I like when everything is changing.

0:35:03.021,0:35:05.096
That makes it's exciting. That's why I do it.

0:35:05.096,0:35:08.011
It's something to be in the storm,

0:35:08.011,0:35:11.040
right in the middle of it and seeing everything

0:35:11.040,0:35:13.038
new happening and putting it all together.

0:35:13.038,0:35:14.019
It's really exciting.

0:35:14.019,0:35:18.007
It's almost addictive. I wouldn't want to leave it,

0:35:18.007,0:35:20.005
that's for sure.

0:35:20.005,0:35:22.019
At times, it's a clear sacrifice

0:35:22.019,0:35:23.051
of elements of your personal life.

0:35:26.011,0:35:28.021
I have to work very hard but I have

0:35:28.021,0:35:30.076
the chance of being rewarded for my efforts.

0:35:30.076,0:35:33.009
This disadvantage, my life's moving on.

0:35:33.009,0:35:34.092
I don't have any children yet,

0:35:34.092,0:35:36.038
you realize there's a certain amount of

0:35:36.038,0:35:39.015
my life that I'm sacrificing I'm going to look back

0:35:39.015,0:35:41.003
and a portion of this life is gone.

0:35:43.009,0:35:46.028
In the U.S., we have at least several million people

0:35:46.028,0:35:49.005
directly making a living from software.

0:35:49.005,0:35:51.001
And it's the fastest growing group of

0:35:51.001,0:35:52.044
people in the economy.

0:35:52.044,0:35:55.025
And it's certainly in aggregate,

0:35:55.025,0:35:57.082
the highest paying field of its size.

0:35:57.082,0:35:59.063
I mean yeah, you've got baseball,

0:35:59.063,0:36:00.094
you've got Hollywood.

0:36:00.094,0:36:02.094
But you know when you really

0:36:02.094,0:36:05.015
think of a group that has millions of people in it,

0:36:05.015,0:36:06.084
these are the highest wages anybody

0:36:06.084,0:36:08.032
has ever seen in the United States.

0:36:14.034,0:36:16.073
The opportunity to win big

0:36:16.073,0:36:19.078
for code writers is very real.

0:36:19.078,0:36:23.065
In fact, that if you will jackpot

0:36:23.065,0:36:26.023
opportunity is reflected here on a

0:36:26.023,0:36:27.078
Wall Street trading desk.

0:36:27.078,0:36:31.007
And I find that a lot of the engineers

0:36:31.007,0:36:33.040
and managers from Silicon Valley

0:36:33.040,0:36:35.051
are very attuned to what goes on

0:36:35.051,0:36:38.046
on these trading floors daily.

0:36:38.046,0:36:42.009
By one account, 64 millionaires are created daily

0:36:42.009,0:36:44.069
in Sillicon Valley where any technology worker

0:36:44.069,0:36:46.086
can striking rich over night.

0:36:46.086,0:36:49.001
You join a company and they give you

0:36:49.001,0:36:51.032
some stock options which basically says,

0:36:51.032,0:36:53.061
rather than just giving you stock,

0:36:53.061,0:36:55.026
they give the right to buy the stock

0:36:55.026,0:36:57.086
in the future at the current price.

0:36:57.086,0:37:03.001
You might get stock in the order of

0:37:03.001,0:37:05.036
maybe a year's salary or

0:37:05.036,0:37:07.080
two years salary typically, worth of options.

0:37:07.080,0:37:10.092
In some of these real booming companies

0:37:10.092,0:37:12.096
out there on the Internet, the potential for

0:37:12.096,0:37:14.078
becoming a millionaire or doing very well,

0:37:14.078,0:37:15.080
is very, very high.

0:37:15.080,0:37:17.034
The people who were very,

0:37:17.034,0:37:19.065
very early, they call them "Mozillionaires".

0:37:19.065,0:37:21.021
Stock options are a con.

0:37:21.021,0:37:24.009
Um, it's a carrot and dangle, it's like,

0:37:24.009,0:37:25.044
oh well, you know if you'll give up

0:37:25.044,0:37:26.050
your one and only youth,

0:37:26.050,0:37:29.007
maybe someday you'll make money, right...

0:37:29.007,0:37:31.046
it's um, I've known so many people

0:37:31.046,0:37:33.073
who have gambled on start-up lottery

0:37:33.073,0:37:34.096
and got nothing.

0:37:34.096,0:37:37.094
You know it's just like lottery ticket, it's a stupid tax.

0:37:37.094,0:37:41.096
Um, I happened to win that particular lottery.

0:37:41.096,0:37:43.088
From the day Microsoft announced

0:37:43.088,0:37:46.032
its aggressive commitment to the Internet, however,

0:37:46.032,0:37:49.003
Netscape stock has been in steady decline,

0:37:49.003,0:37:51.061
and throughout most of 1998 Netscape

0:37:51.061,0:37:54.036
options are essentially worthless.

0:37:54.036,0:37:55.053
A year and a half ago,

0:37:55.053,0:37:57.063
half of our revenue came from browser sales.

0:37:57.063,0:37:59.015
Today none of it does, so well,

0:37:59.015,0:38:01.026
Any business person out there knows

0:38:01.026,0:38:02.034
that that's a huge challenge.

0:38:02.034,0:38:04.048
I mean let me take your number one selling product

0:38:04.048,0:38:05.076
away from you and you replace that

0:38:05.076,0:38:07.001
within period of 12 months or so.

0:38:07.001,0:38:08.067
Not many people want to do that.

0:38:08.067,0:38:11.046
Even though the company sells other Internet products,

0:38:11.046,0:38:14.036
the marketplace views Netscape as a browser company

0:38:14.036,0:38:16.063
in a losing battle with Microsoft.

0:38:18.023,0:38:22.053
- Greg this is Jim Barksdale with Netscape Communications, how are you?

0:38:22.088,0:38:24.098
It's clear that Netscape doesn't have

0:38:24.098,0:38:27.073
enough pieces to threaten Microsoft.

0:38:27.073,0:38:30.065
I don't think that Netscape long term

0:38:30.065,0:38:33.032
can survive as an independent company.

0:38:36.059,0:38:39.028
While Mozilla tries to recapture the early,

0:38:39.028,0:38:41.061
glory days of the company,

0:38:41.061,0:38:44.005
integrating code from the outside means

0:38:44.005,0:38:46.048
more work for everyone on the browser team.

0:38:46.048,0:38:47.090
- Apparently I must have done it backwards

0:38:47.090,0:38:50.063
from what you told me, or I don't know what

0:38:50.063,0:38:52.063
- Ok, then this is bad.

0:38:52.063,0:38:54.088
- We want to take the old free tree

0:38:54.088,0:38:56.061
and use it as subsection,

0:38:56.061,0:38:59.042
and we want to build this interesting tree around this.

0:38:59.042,0:39:00.028
- No that's not want we want to do

0:39:00.028,0:39:01.063
NS Private at the top, right?

0:39:01.063,0:39:04.005
- A project file for this or project file for that,

0:39:04.005,0:39:05.050
it can't be a project file for both.

0:39:05.050,0:39:07.094
We don't have a plan for doing both.

0:39:07.094,0:39:10.009
So right now I have some files that have

0:39:10.009,0:39:12.019
to come from here for Java in a single directory,

0:39:12.019,0:39:13.032
and some files that have to come from here

0:39:13.032,0:39:15.042
in the same directory, the same directory.

0:39:15.048,0:39:16.030
Tell me how I do that?

0:39:19.096,0:39:21.038
That's the problem.

0:39:21.038,0:39:23.071
The browser division which costs the company

0:39:23.071,0:39:26.023
almost 30 million dollars a year to operate

0:39:26.023,0:39:28.065
and contributes few revenues to the company

0:39:28.065,0:39:31.015
is reorganized in the fall for the second time

0:39:31.015,0:39:32.017
in less than a year.

0:39:32.017,0:39:33.076
Do we have all the answers: No.

0:39:33.076,0:39:35.046
We're going to try and learn what we can from

0:39:35.046,0:39:37.019
seeing the people who've done this well...

0:39:37.019,0:39:40.019
When I joined a start-up, I knew that 19 out of 20 fail.

0:39:40.046,0:39:41.088
When an employee comes

0:39:41.088,0:39:43.034
to work at Netscape today,

0:39:43.034,0:39:44.088
he doesn't have the perception

0:39:44.088,0:39:46.046
that there's a 19 out of 20 chance

0:39:46.046,0:39:48.051
that this job is not gonna be in place

0:39:48.051,0:39:49.098
1 to 5 years from now.

0:39:52.075,0:39:56.046
If you live here, it is the ubiquitous conversation

0:39:56.046,0:39:58.030
"Do you believe that Microsoft

0:39:58.030,0:40:00.021
has used either a) illegal

0:40:00.026,0:40:02.038
or just unfair methods

0:40:02.038,0:40:04.063
to take market share from Netscape?"

0:40:04.063,0:40:07.086
And if the heart and soul of this industry is

0:40:07.086,0:40:12.007
opportunity, is egalitarianism, Microsoft having

0:40:12.007,0:40:15.013
achieved its market share

0:40:15.019,0:40:18.082
on anything other than the backs of its code

0:40:18.082,0:40:22.017
really riles every body up.

0:40:22.026,0:40:25.026
Justice department has charged Microsoft

0:40:25.036,0:40:29.065
with engaging an anti-competitive and exclusionary practises

0:40:29.065,0:40:34.046
designed to maintain its monopoly in personal computer operating systems

0:40:34.082,0:40:39.046
and attempting to extend that monopoly to Internet browser software.

0:40:39.067,0:40:41.082
Regardless of its case against Microsoft,

0:40:41.086,0:40:44.065
Netscape has become a victim of its increasing size

0:40:44.069,0:40:46.057
and the growing complexities of its code,

0:40:46.067,0:40:49.015
the company struggles to maintain the vitality

0:40:49.017,0:40:51.015
it enjoyed as a start-up.

0:40:51.057,0:40:53.065
When a company gets to be above a certain size,

0:40:53.065,0:40:57.036
it's just a process, it's a mechanism for making money.

0:40:57.046,0:41:00.013
And innovation is like one possible way of doing that,

0:41:00.015,0:41:00.098
but it's a risky way.

0:41:01.001,0:41:02.067
So companies, big companies don't do that.

0:41:02.076,0:41:06.057
Um, Microsoft actually doesn't do very much, they buy companies.

0:41:06.059,0:41:08.096
They wait until someone has done something interesting and then they acquire them,

0:41:09.009,0:41:10.040
and then they milk it for all it's worth.

0:41:10.042,0:41:15.007
I don't mean to pick on Microsoft because lots of companies do that, it's just the normal way of doing business.

0:41:24.011,0:41:26.030
We're on out way to the Flint Center now.

0:41:26.078,0:41:28.023
We're going to have an all-hands meeting.

0:41:28.026,0:41:32.030
Jim Barksdale has moved up the all hands meeting by roughly about a week.

0:41:32.030,0:41:36.001
We just announce quarterly results and now this major change in direction.

0:41:38.084,0:41:43.000
Well, in case you haven't read the newspaper,

0:41:45.067,0:41:50.098
we have, as of 1:30 this morning,

0:41:52.098,0:42:02.028
concluded negotiations and agreed to sell our company to AOL of Dulles, Virginia.

0:42:06.086,0:42:10.026
I can't imagine that day when they announced the merger,

0:42:10.036,0:42:13.036
that they weren't like "Oh, I don't believe this".

0:42:13.046,0:42:16.030
You know, sort of a nightmare scenario.

0:42:16.030,0:42:17.076
Although, you know, the worst one would have been

0:42:17.076,0:42:19.076
Microsoft's buying us, I guess, you know.

0:42:19.076,0:42:21.088
Then they would have, you know you would've seen like

0:42:21.096,0:42:24.023
his this flow of cars out of Netscape

0:42:24.023,0:42:27.038
Six months ago they were insulting AOL's technology,

0:42:27.038,0:42:30.009
you know, it was the service for idiots.

0:42:30.009,0:42:31.096
"Congratulations skippy, you've got mail!"

0:42:32.036,0:42:37.076
Netscape is not unusual in the way they felt about AOL in Silicon Valley.

0:42:37.076,0:42:39.096
I mean, it's very clear that nobody

0:42:39.096,0:42:41.046
had any respect for the company.

0:42:41.046,0:42:42.094
One of them at Netscape

0:42:42.094,0:42:45.005
called Steve Case a soap salesman

0:42:45.005,0:42:47.005
because he used to work at Proctor and Gamble.

0:42:48.007,0:42:49.032
The soap salesman bought them.

0:42:50.076,0:42:54.017
The quote that came out of this article was

0:42:54.017,0:42:57.059
"Netscape: (similar lines of) lived fast,

0:42:57.059,0:42:59.057
died young, and left a tired corpse".

0:42:59.067,0:43:03.046
And I don't know they agree with that.

0:43:04.030,0:43:05.086
I don't think Netscape's done yet.

0:43:05.086,0:43:07.011
They bought us because they like us,

0:43:07.011,0:43:07.098
they like what we do,

0:43:08.026,0:43:10.063
and they don't want to disturb that formula;

0:43:11.023,0:43:13.086
so their plan is to not damage us in any way.

0:43:14.032,0:43:16.015
There had been alot of, uh,

0:43:16.023,0:43:17.094
a lot of speculation out on the net,

0:43:17.094,0:43:19.038
you know, in the free software community, like

0:43:19.038,0:43:20.082
oh well this is it, you know,

0:43:20.082,0:43:21.067
it's all over now

0:43:21.067,0:43:23.038
"AOL's just gonna screw everything up".

0:43:23.038,0:43:24.015
So I wrote this thing

0:43:24.015,0:43:25.073
that I put on the Mozilla.org site

0:43:25.073,0:43:27.080
that just laid out the worst case scenario,

0:43:27.080,0:43:28.076
like, well okay,

0:43:29.026,0:43:31.046
even if everything goes wrong

0:43:31.055,0:43:33.061
it's still not as bad as you're saying it is.

0:43:33.084,0:43:36.036
Because the nature of what Netscape did

0:43:36.036,0:43:39.098
meant that the code belongs to the community now.

0:43:40.034,0:43:42.065
Few days later I got email from Steve Case,

0:43:42.065,0:43:44.057
saying, um, we think that you're doing is great thing

0:43:44.057,0:43:45.069
and it's part of the reason we bought the company

0:43:45.069,0:43:47.038
we plan to keep it going that way, so

0:43:47.084,0:43:52.019
um, as far as Mozilla.org and Netscape and AOL's contribution

0:43:52.034,0:43:55.075
to the open-source movement goes,

0:43:55.075,0:43:57.026
he says, it's gonna continue...

0:43:58.032,0:44:01.071
The merger with AOL creates a windfall for shareholders

0:44:01.071,0:44:05.055
that will give Netscape employees the chance to cash out and move on,

0:44:05.065,0:44:07.092
causing speculation in the national media

0:44:07.092,0:44:11.076
about AOL's ability to retain Netscape's key people.

0:44:12.065,0:44:14.026
And already I hear, you know,

0:44:14.026,0:44:16.023
that AOL people come at Netscape and say,

0:44:16.023,0:44:17.057
yeah this is the AOL way.

0:44:17.057,0:44:19.067
It's not gonna work at Netscape.

0:44:19.067,0:44:22.090
It's gonna be the Netscape way with help from AOL!

0:44:22.090,0:44:24.065
I suspect some of them will leave.

0:44:24.065,0:44:26.080
You know, they don't want to be part of AOL.

0:44:26.090,0:44:29.011
Some people just like the start-up mentality.

0:44:29.026,0:44:32.000
And those that want to be part of a juggernaut

0:44:32.000,0:44:33.092
are going to stay and be part of the juggernaut.

0:44:34.028,0:44:38.001
I've been at Netscape for 3 and a half years and it feels like forever.

0:44:38.040,0:44:44.019
And AOL's focus and Netscape's growing focus has been marketing and advertising,

0:44:44.019,0:44:45.023
all that stuff, and that's

0:44:45.096,0:44:48.053
not nearly as interesting

0:44:48.053,0:44:50.080
to someone who's sort of a techno-fetishist.

0:44:50.090,0:44:53.028
I'm switching jobs and selling my house,

0:44:53.028,0:44:55.000
I'm moving, switching towns...

0:44:56.067,0:45:00.009
That's life for start-up land.

0:45:01.019,0:45:03.015
I'm still young and stupid as I like to put it,

0:45:03.015,0:45:05.005
so I can get away with that stuff like that.

0:45:06.019,0:45:10.011
Year and a half ago, so Tara comes to me she says

0:45:10.011,0:45:13.057
"I want to be a manager so bad, that I can taste it".

0:45:13.057,0:45:17.055
So we finally said alright, you get to be a manager.

0:45:17.055,0:45:20.055
And like within a week she said

0:45:20.055,0:45:22.075
"Why did you ever let me do this?"

0:45:25.075,0:45:30.009
And Tara has turned out to be like one of Netscape's greatest managers.

0:45:30.019,0:45:34.019
So here is to Tara, release team manager.

0:45:34.071,0:45:37.055
Tara leaves Netscape for an e-commerce start-up,

0:45:37.055,0:45:40.063
missing out on a big jump in the value of her stock options

0:45:40.063,0:45:42.094
in hopes for a bigger pay out at her new company.

0:45:52.076,0:45:57.069
Regardless of how AOL runs the Netscape business,

0:45:57.080,0:45:59.098
it's not Netscape anymore - that part's over.

0:45:59.098,0:46:01.080
And you know, that's really sad

0:46:01.080,0:46:04.023
I wish Netscape could have gone it on their own.

0:46:04.026,0:46:08.050
Frustrated by what he perceives as a lack of commitment to open-source development,

Jamie quits Netscape one year to the day he helped to give away Mozilla.

0:46:13.034,0:46:16.019
The movie Hackers I think is just a great movie.

0:46:16.030,0:46:18.000
I wish our lives were like that,

0:46:18.000,0:46:21.015
I wish we were roller skating around in spandex and fighting bad guys,

0:46:21.015,0:46:25.065
but you know it's not it's sitting in a room and typing all day.

0:46:28.015,0:46:31.073
This is what I was trying to escape, this life.

0:46:31.073,0:46:33.094
I knew I did not want to live here.

0:46:36.046,0:46:38.075
I've been out here now about four of five years.

0:46:38.075,0:46:43.050
This is a nice place. This is escape from the jungle.

0:46:48.059,0:46:53.007
Jim Roskind is promoted to Netscape's highest engineering rank.

0:46:53.098,0:46:55.094
Last night I was here at four in the morning,

0:46:55.098,0:46:59.019
and this isn't even in the middle of a critical push.

0:46:59.030,0:47:01.084
But it's almost like an addiction, an adrenaline rush,

0:47:01.084,0:47:03.090
a going for perfection, a pushing.

0:47:03.090,0:47:08.048
And then as you see the results, you get the feedback to push harder.

0:47:12.096,0:47:14.098
You know I really shouldn't comment on this

0:47:14.098,0:47:16.038
since I'm just as foolish as everyone else is

0:47:16.038,0:47:18.007
but I'll just go ahead and do it while admitting that I'm foolish,

0:47:18.007,0:47:20.090
there's just a tremendous quest for material wealth here.

0:47:21.000,0:47:23.019
It's like the goldrush all over again.

0:47:24.009,0:47:26.040
And this is gonna be the playhouse.

0:47:26.050,0:47:29.021
And then this will be like a front porch I think a little flowers and stuff.

0:47:29.021,0:47:30.067
So it will be like a cute little house.

0:47:30.090,0:47:34.080
I went to Netscape because its main purpose was to generate cash,

0:47:34.090,0:47:36.050
based on this Internet thing.

0:47:36.050,0:47:38.057
It's like what we're gonna do, we're gonna get rich.

0:47:38.057,0:47:41.088
It just took a heavy toll on our marriage,

0:47:41.088,0:47:44.050
and, if it wasn't for God's grace,

0:47:44.059,0:47:46.003
we wouldn't have made it.

0:47:46.009,0:47:49.044
"Why would I use god gives"

0:47:50.000,0:47:51.080
Micheal burned out.

0:47:51.090,0:47:57.003
Micheal, came to a place, in his own life where he said the cost is too great,

0:47:57.003,0:47:59.019
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

0:47:59.076,0:48:02.048
If people are - would look at this and say oh

0:48:02.048,0:48:04.098
hey this is a cool thing, I'm gonna start a start-up

0:48:04.098,0:48:06.075
and get rich quick

0:48:06.075,0:48:08.036
I would just have to say

0:48:08.036,0:48:09.073
you need to count the costs

0:48:10.009,0:48:13.036
because you can't ever retrieve the time that's lost.

0:48:13.096,0:48:15.026
Michael Toy

0:48:15.026,0:48:17.009
Netscape employee number 6

0:48:17.009,0:48:19.030
achieved his goal of financial independance

0:48:19.030,0:48:22.094
and retired from Netscape shortly after Mozilla's release.

0:48:29.011,0:48:30.032
In the Valley,

0:48:30.032,0:48:33.069
if you've stayed someplace longer than about three years

0:48:33.069,0:48:35.021
people wonder what's going on?

0:48:35.021,0:48:37.021
Why can't you get another job, what's wrong with you?

0:48:37.021,0:48:39.021
If you're a programmer, you pretty much change jobs

0:48:39.021,0:48:41.021
about every two years or so.

0:48:42.005,0:48:43.021
It's like ants,

0:48:43.021,0:48:43.088
worker ants.

0:48:43.088,0:48:45.088
They send out a group out to do something.

0:48:45.088,0:48:47.065
As that group approaches

0:48:47.065,0:48:48.096
the task that they're gonna do

0:48:48.096,0:48:50.096
some ants leave, more ants come on

0:48:50.096,0:48:53.001
By the time it gets to the target

0:48:53.001,0:48:54.050
it could be a totally different set of ants

0:48:54.071,0:48:58.051
I think as we distribute the set of work that we're doing

0:48:58.051,0:49:00.051
and more and more, in the Information Age

0:49:01.048,0:49:02.061
it'll be more like that.

0:49:03.034,0:49:07.011
Scott Collins continues to commute to Netscape from Michigan.

0:49:11.044,0:49:12.082
There's lot of pressure right now

0:49:12.082,0:49:14.082
to complete our product on time.

0:49:15.026,0:49:17.048
Um, sort of wade in with

0:49:17.071,0:49:21.042
the ridiculous acrobatics the stock is doing.

0:49:21.075,0:49:23.042
We were a 20$ company

0:49:23.042,0:49:26.082
and as of this moment our stock is at 172$.

0:49:27.030,0:49:29.088
So it's hard to be depressed about the amount of work

0:49:29.088,0:49:31.055
you have to do when

0:49:31.055,0:49:33.055
every other cube holds a millionnaire.

0:49:35.046,0:49:38.090
When the deal with AOL closes in the Spring of 1999

0:49:38.090,0:49:43.013
the value of Netscape's stock more than doubled since the merger's announcement.

0:49:44.028,0:49:45.082
Netscape married right.

0:49:46.032,0:49:49.026
They hitched their fortunes to AOL

0:49:49.026,0:49:51.026
when the transaction was announced,

0:49:51.038,0:49:54.084
the implied valuation was about 4.2 billion

0:49:54.098,0:49:56.084
when transaction was completed,

0:49:57.023,0:50:00.017
the transaction was valued at 10 billion.

0:50:00.017,0:50:04.034
So in effect about 5.5 or 6 billion dollars

0:50:04.034,0:50:06.063
of net worth was created

0:50:06.063,0:50:10.046
so I think it was the very clever deal-making

0:50:10.046,0:50:13.088
of Netscape management that kept them in the game

0:50:13.088,0:50:18.055
much longer and Netscape's shareholders benefited quite considerably.

0:50:19.051,0:50:20.073

-la

0:50:22.094,0:50:24.028
lives!

0:50:24.028,0:50:26.044
While many executives sold their stock

0:50:26.044,0:50:28.003
during Netscape's final year

0:50:28.003,0:50:29.061
Barksdale bought more

0:50:29.061,0:50:31.088
and after the merger he swapped his shares

0:50:31.088,0:50:35.000
for more than half a billion dollars of AOL stock.

0:50:39.009,0:50:40.090
Another young man comes west

0:50:40.090,0:50:44.021
to seek his fortune on technology's new frontier.

0:50:44.021,0:50:46.090
I'm a little bit nervous going into this interview,

0:50:46.090,0:50:50.030
cause I'm not entirely sure what to expect.

0:50:50.030,0:50:52.017
It's a long way away

0:50:52.017,0:50:54.005
Three thousand miles

0:50:54.005,0:50:57.026
is a long way for your child to be

0:50:57.026,0:51:02.036
But this is a place where there's a lot going on that

0:51:02.036,0:51:04.040
he's very interested in and I think

0:51:04.040,0:51:06.040
has some talents in this area.

0:51:06.040,0:51:09.046
And I really think that this may be

0:51:10.042,0:51:13.017
kind of home for him as far as

0:51:13.017,0:51:15.017
being able to work with people

0:51:15.017,0:51:17.051
that he can actually talk to.

0:51:23.026,0:51:24.094
- Pavlov!

0:51:27.051,0:51:29.038
- What I want to know is,

0:51:29.051,0:51:30.086
what you want to do

0:51:30.086,0:51:33.063
I mean, what your goals are in the next couple of years?

0:51:33.063,0:51:35.003
- My goal right now

0:51:35.003,0:51:38.069
is that I want to see the UNIX version faster than the Windows version.

0:51:39.055,0:51:41.007
Once you pull that off,

0:51:41.007,0:51:43.026
then, you know, we'll see.

0:51:43.030,0:51:44.028
But that's my goal.

0:51:45.073,0:51:47.086
Pavlov is hired by Netscape.

0:51:47.086,0:51:50.015
He postpones going to college.

0:51:52.036,0:51:55.005
Taking part in what one investor has called the largest

0:51:55.005,0:51:57.073
legal creation of wealth in the history of the planet,

0:51:57.073,0:52:00.059
David Readerman moves to a new investment bank.

0:52:04.030,0:52:05.057
Here's the data center,

0:52:05.057,0:52:08.017
a lot of cable, a lot of fiber.

0:52:08.034,0:52:12.026
These can be sort of, you know, Internet connections

0:52:12.032,0:52:14.078
they can be our trading lines, our phone lines.

0:52:14.078,0:52:17.078
You know we're lying the infrastructure

0:52:17.078,0:52:21.003
to basically build a major merchant bank.

0:52:21.057,0:52:24.051
Our view is that the Internet changes everything

0:52:24.051,0:52:26.084
and we're going to finance the companies

0:52:26.084,0:52:29.032
that want to be the agents of that change.

0:52:36.086,0:52:38.003
Look at this intersection,

0:52:38.003,0:52:40.032
we've got a bank here,

0:52:40.032,0:52:42.098
in two years you know this may not be here,

0:52:42.098,0:52:45.032
why not bank online?

0:52:47.051,0:52:49.015
Gap's website

0:52:49.015,0:52:52.059
is one of the most successful commerce websites

0:52:52.059,0:52:54.059
on the market.

0:52:56.007,0:52:59.003
I don't even know why Gap's renovating this store?

0:52:59.003,0:53:01.059
Why aren't they investing more in their website?

0:53:03.036,0:53:06.048
I don't know what this intersection may look two years from now.

0:53:09.023,0:53:11.017
When I started people didn't know what HTML was,

0:53:11.017,0:53:12.088
what the World Wide Web was, and then all of a sudden

0:53:12.088,0:53:14.088
the power of the Internet that had been there

0:53:14.088,0:53:17.013
for years was available to everybody

0:53:17.025,0:53:20.032
in an easy way, Point & click, the universal language.

0:53:20.032,0:53:23.076
It's like in Fantasia when Mickey is standing over

0:53:23.084,0:53:25.040
the book that's open on the mountain,

0:53:25.040,0:53:26.051
and he's looking in to see what to do

0:53:26.051,0:53:28.051
and he does something. And he doesn't really know what he does

0:53:28.075,0:53:29.088
but it makes something happen.

0:53:29.088,0:53:32.026
And of course this thing gets out of control and keeps going.

0:53:32.028,0:53:33.098
You don't know why it works, you don't know how it works,

0:53:33.098,0:53:35.078
you just push a button and it works.

0:53:35.078,0:53:37.080
We're at the beginning of an industry and

0:53:37.080,0:53:39.080
who knows where that industry's gonna go?

0:53:39.080,0:53:41.088
This could all turn into television again.

0:53:41.088,0:53:44.057
It could be controlled by a small number of

0:53:45.086,0:53:48.017
companies who decide what we see and hear.

0:53:48.017,0:53:50.017
And there's a lot of precedent for that.

0:53:51.034,0:53:53.051
I'm just laying down the tracks

0:53:53.051,0:53:55.051
and there were these trains zooming by me,

0:53:55.051,0:53:57.044
and there's no way I'd want to say it's a

0:53:57.044,0:53:59.044
bad thing to have these trains fly by.

0:54:00.038,0:54:01.086
I could be a horrible legacy.

0:54:01.086,0:54:04.023
If it ended up being a legacy of,

0:54:04.023,0:54:06.059
you know, Netscape and the Internet,

0:54:07.036,0:54:09.007
that we could all like,

0:54:10.019,0:54:11.067
do what we're doing only under

0:54:11.067,0:54:13.036
much more intense pressure and

0:54:13.067,0:54:14.071
much faster.

0:54:17.009,0:54:18.044
Everything has to change faster,

0:54:18.044,0:54:20.015
obviously, you know, look at Netscape.

0:54:20.015,0:54:22.015
It was born and died.

0:54:22.015,0:54:23.094
I don't want to use the word "died", they wouldn't like that word.

0:54:23.094,0:54:26.030
But basically it was born and overtaken

0:54:26.030,0:54:27.076
within four years.

0:54:27.076,0:54:30.005
That's pretty fast, I think.

0:54:30.040,0:54:31.082
They must think it's very fast.

0:54:31.082,0:54:33.082
Near the end of 1999,

0:54:33.082,0:54:35.051
the public still awaits Netscape's

0:54:35.051,0:54:37.051
first open source browser,

0:54:37.051,0:54:39.098
more than a year after Mozilla was released.

0:54:40.026,0:54:42.011
The judge and the justice department

0:54:42.011,0:54:44.044
end a trust trial rules that Microsoft

0:54:44.046,0:54:46.076
is a monopoly, it stiffles innovation.

0:54:46.076,0:54:48.057
AOL begins the millenium

0:54:48.059,0:54:50.061
with a new even larger aquisition,

0:54:50.061,0:54:53.042
and investors continue buying technology stocks,

0:54:53.042,0:54:56.021
which trade with increasing volatility.

0:54:56.086,0:54:59.028
Still as the Internet finds its way

0:54:59.028,0:55:01.005
into every corner of daily life,

0:55:01.005,0:55:03.017
so, too will legions of programmers

0:55:03.017,0:55:05.038
and their code, working fast

0:55:05.038,0:55:07.038
and late into the night.
