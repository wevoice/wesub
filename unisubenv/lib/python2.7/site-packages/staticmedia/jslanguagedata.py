"""Render javascript language data

This module allows you to render javascript code to handle language data for
the current locale.  It provides some of the functionality of the
utils.translation module to our javascript code.  In particular:

  - Listing all languages
  - Listing popular languages
  - Getting a display name of a language choice in a selectbox

The main reason this exists is the lists are fairly long, so we need to be
careful about them exploding the size of the pages.  In particular, it would
take ~10K of code to display a selectbox that lists all languages and
sometimes we want to display many on a page.

To combat this, we place the code in static files on S3 -- one for each locale.
This eliminates the issue of having to duplicate the options and also allows
the script to be stored in the browser cache.
